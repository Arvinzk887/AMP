			<h2>Chapter 3: The 7 Costly Pitfalls Preventing All-Market Trading Success</h2>
			<p>Trading is not easy. It’s made infinitely more complex by a
variety of factors.</p>
			<p>After over three decades of trading and spending thousands
on trading courses and personally working with hundreds of
traders, I’ve learned things you can only learn by trying, failing,
				and trying again.</p>
<p>I want to share with you the seven pitfalls both aspiring traders
and experienced traders make when aiming for longterm
	success.</p>
<p>I want to share these for two reasons:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>So that you can learn from these mistakes and avoid
				making them yourself.</li>
			<li>To show you why I’m passionate about using truly
non-directional “All-Market Profits” trading strategies to
protect and grow portfolios.</li></ol>
			<p>Some of these pitfalls may hit close to home. Others may
not seem relevant to you - yet. But, believe me, if you want
lasting success as an options trader, you need to be (at least)
cognizant of them all.</p>
<p>While the chapter is extensive, I believe the knowledge acquired
will be invaluable as you progress through this book
and work towards achieving consistent profitability in various
market conditions. Take the time to fully absorb the information
presented, as it will serve you well when applying
	the “All-Market Profits” framework in Part 2 of this book.</p>
<p>Let’s begin!</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>TRADER PITFALL number 1: CHOOSING THE WRONG INFORMATION SOURCE</b></p>
			<p>As a non-professional trader trying to make your fortune
from your own home, choosing which information sources
you learn from is imperative for your education and your
				success. The problem?</p>
<p><strong>Most Sources Are Either Biased, Not Transparent, or
(worse) Unprofitable</strong></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Source number 1: The Stock-Picking Media Machine</b></p>
		  <p>On the one hand, you have the “talking heads” on cable news
networks who offer an endless stream of (often conflicting)
stock-picking advice. These media personalities come with
an “impressive” resume from Wall Street top firms. They use
a mix of complex jargon and selective analysis to lead the
novice “return chasing” investor to believe their word for
		  gold.</p>
<p>In reality, their incentive is more aligned with padding their
ego and their companies’ wallets rather than dishing out
	credible investing advice.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the most notable television stock picker
of all, CNBC’s “Mad Money” host, Jim Cramer. Research
studies have shown that over 17 plus years reviewed, Jim Cramer
has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 total return index both
	on an overall returns basis and in the Sharpe ratio.1</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s advisable to view these programs more as a
source of entertainment than as a reliable foundation for investment
education.2</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Source number 2: The Wild West of Online Trading Educators or Gurus</b></p>
		  <p>The emergence of social media has ushered in a “Wild West”
of self-proclaimed trading and investment educators who
promise riches but aren’t actually profitable themselves.
These educators are more focused on selling the dream of
		  wealth than delivering actual, profitable trading strategies.</p>
<p>In fact, I believe (at least) 95 percent of the trading educators on
the internet are overhyped “snake oil” salesmen, grifters,
and con artists meant to hustle you out of your time and
hard-earned money. They, unfortunately, use slick, deceptive
advertising to prey on desperate people who want to
	“get rich quick” without effort.</p>
<p>I would know because I went on a crusade and publicly reviewed
30 plus online trading courses on my YouTube channel.
On the channel, I investigate many of the well-known trading
gurus and their strategies in an effort to bring the best
trading strategies to light and to help the average consumer
avoid wasting their money and time. A few of these gurus
have threatened me with cease and desist letters and I’ve
even been sued.</p>
<p>Now, why would I spend my time researching and litigating
if I have my own strategies that work?</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Unselfish Reason: My mission is to add value and ensure
that you’re successful regardless if you decide to
learn with me or not. If I can help save you time, money,
				and effort by avoiding scams, I’ve done my job.</li>
				<li>Selfish Reason: I am fanatical about perfecting my trading
so if a person is touting a “better” strategy, I’ll investigate
to see if they do something I am not doing so
I can implement it myself. 99 percent of the time, I come up
empty-handed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here is what I found.</p>
