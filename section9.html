			<h2>Chapter 7 point 1: The Exact Construction of the
A.M.P. 1-2-2 Option Structure</h2>
			<p>In the previous chapters, we’ve laid the groundwork as to
why I believe a “Proactively Hedged Put Broken Wing Butterfly”
(The A.M.P. 1-2-2) is a great starting point when aiming
for all market profits due to positive Theta, flat Delta and
				Gamma, and long volatility exposure.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to dive into how I would construct this trade
	structure, including the underlyings, widths, and expirations.</p>
			<p><b>First Here Is a Quick Recap &amp; Overview of the Structure:</b></p>
			<table>
			<th>The All Market Profits Options Structure -
The A.M.P. 1-2-2</th>
			<tr>

			</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p><b>Construction Principles:</b></p>
			<p>Crafting the ideal options structure for all market conditions
is no easy feat. It requires countless hours of backtesting,
analyzing, and refining to find the perfect balance between
				risk and reward.</p>
<p>Throughout my trading career, I’ve conducted over 10,000
backtests on various options strategies, meticulously studying
their performance across different market environments.
The exact details of the A.M.P. 1-2-2 options structure I’m
about to share with you are the result of this rigorous process
- a culmination of years of trial and error, optimization,
	and fine-tuning.</p>
<p>By following the construction principles outlined next, you’ll
be able to shortcut your way to a proven, reliable options
structure that has the potential to weather any storm the
	market throws your way.</p>
			<p><b>Underlying:</b></p>
<p>When it comes to selecting the underlying asset for your options
structure, liquidity and cost efficiency should be top
priorities. That’s why I prefer to trade options on broad market
indexes such as the SPX or the forward slash ES E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures.
These underlyings offer several key advantages.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Advantage Number 1: Liquidity &amp; Commissions</p>
			<p>Liquidity and slippage should be paramount concerns when
trading. If you have a position in a stock or equity option with
little volume, you could be trapped into paying an exorbitant
				amount of slippage.</p>
<p>I focus my options trading on the most liquid, cost-effective
equity underlying SPX. You can trade options on the SPY,
which is very liquid but only 1/10 the size of SPX, or the E mini
	futures symbol /ES, which is half the size of SPX.</p>
<p>SPX has the advantage of lower commissions because I
can pay for commissions to trade 1 SPX contract and get the
leverage of trading 10 SPY contracts. If I pay to trade 10 SPY
	contracts, I would pay 10 times the commissions.</p>
<p>While that seems obvious, it’s very important to not overlook
the role commissions have when factoring in the cost of doing
business.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Advantage Number 2: Tax-Advantaged 1256 Contracts</p>
			<p>Many options traders are unaware of the significant tax savings
available when trading certain options products like
index options on the S&amp;P 500 (SPX). SPX options are considered
Section 1256 contracts by the IRS and receive preferential
				tax treatment.</p>
<p>For short-term capital gains on non-1256 options and equities
held less than one year, the tax rate is typically around
28%. However, with 1256 contracts like SPX options, only
40% of the gains are taxed at the higher short-term rate
while 60% are taxed at the lower, long-term capital gains
	rate of around 15%.</p>
<p>The ability to get lower blended tax rates by trading options
on indices like SPX can substantially improve overall profits
due to tax savings. This is not well understood by many options
	traders.</p>
<p>For example, on $100,000 in short-term capital gains, the
total tax bill would be $28,000 using regular options at the
28% rate, but with SPX 1256 contracts, the total tax would
	only be $20,200 due to the blended 20% effective rate.</p>
<p>This saves $8,000 in taxes on the $100,000 in gains, or an
extra 8% more in net profit. Just by choosing tax-advantaged
options like SPX to trade, overall returns can be meaningfully
improved after tax.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Advantage Number 3: Diversification Through “Teenies”</p>
			<p>Trading options on broad market indexes like the SPX or /ES
presents a unique opportunity to diversify your portfolio and
protect against market crashes through the strategic use of
				“teenie” options.</p>
<p>Firstly, index options provide inherent diversification by
granting exposure to a wide array of stocks across multiple
sectors. This built-in diversification helps mitigate the impact
of single-stock risk and sector-specific volatility on your
	overall portfolio.</p>
<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, index options allow
you to leverage “teenies” - far out-of-the-money put options
with Deltas around 0.03 - as a cost-effective crash insurance
policy. By proactively incorporating “teenies” into your options strategy, you can position yourself to capitalize on the
	exponential gains that often accompany market downturns.</p>
<p>The power of “teenies” lies in their affordability, scalability,
and potential for outsized returns during crashes. As panicked
investors rush to hedge their portfolios during a market
meltdown, the demand for these far out-of-the-money
puts skyrockets, leading to exponential price increases. By
already owning “teenies” before the crash occurs, you can
	turn the tables on market chaos and reap significant rewards.</p>
			<p><b>Strike Prices, Widths, &amp; Deltas:</b></p>
<p>The next crucial aspect of the All-Market Profits 1-2-2 is selecting
the appropriate strike prices and widths. Here’s a
breakdown of a typical position:</p>
			<table>
			<th class="center-text">Breakdown (1 Tranche):</th><th></th>
			<tr>
				<td>Legs</td><td>Contract Type | Quantity | Delta</td></tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Upper Long</td><td>Buy plus 1 Puts at negative 30 Delta</td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Middle Short</td><td>Sell minus 2 Puts at negative 18 Delta</td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Lower Long</td><td>Buy plus 2 Puts at negative 03 Delta</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p><b>This breakdown accomplishes the following objectives:</b></p>
			<p>Objective #1: Out-Of-The-Money</p>
			<p>The entire structure is placed around 100 to 250 points outof-
the-money (if trading SPX) depending on volatility levels.
Placing the trade strikes a balance between returns while
				mitigating risk with a long and flat Gamma runway.</p>
			<p>Objective #2: Delta Neutrality</p>
<p>The next objective with each new open position is to obtain
Delta neutrality. If you were to add up the total Delta of the
legs, the aim is to keep it as close to zero as possible.</p>
			<table>
			<th>Contracts</th><th>Delta</th><th>Delta of Each Leg</th>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td><td>-30</td><td>-30</td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Minus 2</td><td>-18</td><td>36</td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td><td>-3</td><td>-6</td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Total Position Delta</td><td></td><td>0</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Once the initial strategy is built, I analyze the trade’s Delta
before execution to ensure it is as neutral as possible. To
obtain a more neutral Delta, I will reposition the Upper Long
				contracts by moving the strike price either upward or downward.</p>
<p>Objective #3: Positioning &amp; Dynamic Widths Based
	On Deltas</p>
<p>I prefer to determine the widths of the legs using “Delta-
Based Selection” rather than based on fixed widths of
strike prices. This means that the “width” of each leg of the
structure (in terms of strike prices) will not always be the
same due to volatility and underlying conditions when the
	trade is placed.</p>
<p>In a high-volatility environment, the structure would typically
be further out of the money because it gives you more room
for the underlying asset to move without affecting your position adversely. Higher volatility implies that the outer wings
can be set wider apart and you can afford to place the structure
further out of the money, capturing more premium while
	managing risk.</p>
<p>Conversely, in a lower-volatility environment, the structure
would be closer to the current market price (closer to the
money) to capture more premium, as there’s less expectation
	of drastic price movements.</p>
			<p><b>Expirations</b></p>
<p>Choosing the appropriate expiration for your options structure
is a balancing act between maximizing Theta decay and
maintaining a sufficient runway for the trade to develop.
I prefer to place my trades around 100-150 days until
expiration for the following reasons:</p>
			<p><b>Positive Headroom:</b></p>
<p>By selecting an expiration that is roughly 100 to 150
days out, the structure can benefit from significant
Theta decay while still maintaining a long enough
runway to with-stand short-term price fluctuations.
This positive head-room is essential for the overall
	profitability of the strategy.</p>
			<p><b>Flat Gamma Profile:</b></p>
<p>With a longer expiration, the Gamma profile of the structure
remains relatively flat, providing a more stable Delta
over time. This flat Gamma profile helps to minimize
the impact of directional moves on the position’s profitability.</p>
			<p>If you choose to go closer in time than 100 - 150 days until
expira-tion, while you’ll experience more Theta decay, you
will also have a shorter runway and a less flat Gamma line
and, there-fore, you’ll have less downside protection.
Furthermore, in order to manage this shorter runway and
directional risk, you might have to make more adjustments
and adjustments cost money and drawdowns could
				potentially be higher.</p>
<p>On the flip side, if I choose to go farther out in time, I’d
cer-tainly have a longer runway and less risk, but the returns
and Theta decay will also be lower.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Chapter Summary</p>
			<p>The All-Market Profits 1-2-2 is a robust options
structure that combines the benefits of positive
Theta, flat Delta and Gamma, and long volatility
exposure to deliver consistent profits in all market
conditions. By carefully selecting the underlying
asset, strike prices, widths, and expiration, we
can create a foundation for a truly non-directional,
				all-market trading strategy.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will explore how to determine
the optimal position sizing for this structure,
taking into account factors such as account size,
risk tolerance, and market conditions. Position sizing
is a critical component of risk management and
essential for the long-term success of any trading
strategy.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Key Chapter Takeaways</p>
			<ol>
			<li>In this chapter, we covered the exact construction of
the All-Market Profits 1-2-2 option structure, including
the selection of the underlying asset, days to expiration,
				and strike price widths.</li>
<li>Selecting the right underlying asset is crucial for liquidity,
cost-efficiency, and diversification. Broad market indexes,
like SPX or /ES, are preferred for their liquidity,
tax advantages (Section 1256 contracts), and the ability
	to profit from market crashes using “teenies.”</li>
<li>Strike prices and widths are strategically chosen to create
a Delta-neutral, out-of-the-money structure with a
long Gamma runway. Positioning is based on dynamic
widths determined by Deltas rather than fixed strike
	price ratios.</li>
<li>Expiration dates are selected around 100 - 150 days to
expiration to balance Theta decay and Gamma profile.
This provides a sufficient runway for the trade to
	develop while benefiting from time decay.</li>
<li>By understanding the intricacies of the All-Market Profits
1-2-2 option structure, we now have the foundation
for a robust, all-market trading strategy that can deliver
consistent results across various market environments.</li>
