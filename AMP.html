            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>What if you could make money in the stock market without needing a “crystal ball” or fancy “magic wand” indicator?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, what if you could remove any discretion, emotions, or subjectivity from your trading?</p>
			<p>Do you suppose your trading will become a bit more enjoyable, consistent, and profitable?</p>
			<p><b>That is the goal of this book:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>To show that success in the stock market does not need to come from ‘timing the market’ or predicting whether a stock’s price will rise or fall.</li>
                <li>To help you remove emotions from your decision-making and throw all your “trading psychology” books in the trash.</li>
                <li>Finally, it is possible to profit in all market types - bull, bear, sideways, and crashes - when you have a well-designed options investing approach that removes both “directional bets” and “discretionary tactics” from the equation.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>I call this truly non-directional and mechanical approach the “All-Market Profits” Trading Framework (A.M.P. for short).</p>
          <p>By the time you finish this book, I aim to give the principles and framework for implementing and tailoring your own All-Market Profits strategy in your own trading, paving the way for you to work with me and my team directly if you seek expert guidance.</p>
          <p><strong>To that end, I have structured this book as follows:</strong></p>
          <p>First, we will explore the pitfalls and shortcomings that have likely hindered your trading success thus far. Through frank self-assessments, I will provide you with an honest evaluation of your current approach based on my decades of experience in navigating the markets.</p>
          <p>Next, I will make a case for adopting a truly non-directional, volatility-harnessing strategy that removes the need for prediction and market timing. You will soon understand why such an approach is the answer to the struggles faced by many traders.</p>
          <p>We will then dive deep into the core principles and components of the “All-Market Profits” trading methodology. My students and I use this approach to achieve consistent profits across bull, bear, sideways, and even crash environments.</p>
          <p>From there, you will learn how to construct, optimize, and manage one of my favorite option trading structures. This unique, unconventional, proprietary structure is a foundation for truly non-directional trading. I will share insights into harnessing higher-order Greeks, executing trades, managing positions, and backtesting strategies for long-term success.</p>
          <p>The goal is for you to emerge from this book armed with a comprehensive understanding of how to build and implement your own “All-Market Profits” system, tailored to your 6 individual needs and risk tolerance.</p>
          <p>It might sound like a lot, but really, the entirety of this book can be summed up in the following three points:</p>
<p><strong>Point #1:</strong> Consistent trading success does not rely on predicting market movements but rather on controlling risk through truly non-directional, volatility-hedged strategies.</p>
          <p><strong>Point #2:</strong> By harnessing proven statistical edges and higher-order option Greeks, it is possible to generate profits across all market conditions without falling prey to emotional decision-making.</p>
          <p><strong>Point #3:</strong> The “All-Market Profits” approach outlined in this book provides a robust, data-driven framework for achieving this goal, backed by decades of experience and continuous refinement.</p>
          <p>No more falling victim to “fake gurus” promising unrealistic riches. No more struggling with strategies that falter in certain market conditions. The approach you are about to discover has been instrumental in transforming my own trading journey, allowing me and the traders I’ve mentored to navigate market complexities with consistency, peace of mind, and outperformance. I hope that through this book, you will be able to forge a similar path to lasting trading success.</p>
          <p>More than just a trading guide, this book is a blueprint for designing a trading business that aligns with your values, 7 goals, and lifestyle aspirations - to help you get one step closer to claiming your financial destiny.</p>
          <p>If, after reading this book, you find yourself eager to implement the “All-Market Profits” trading approach under expert guidance, I invite you to book a call with me or my team by visiting:</p>

          <p>Every trader is unique. We are here to support you and tailor the principles you’ll learn in this book based on your unique goals, experience, and risk tolerances. Helping traders like yourself achieve consistent, risk-managed profits through non-directional strategies is the core mission of my work.</p>
          <p>To your trading success,</p>

          <h2>Chapter 1: Becoming an All Market Trader</h2>
            <p>Don’t be like me. At the time of this writing, I am 56 years old. I’ve been obsessed with passive income ever since I was 19. My goal has always been the same: make as much money with as little “work” as possible.</p>
            <p>In other words, I wanted to retire early and do what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it and not have money get in the way - I am sure most of you share that common goal.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2: Who Is This Book For?</h2>
            <p>This book is for you if you are a “Battle-Scarred Trader.” A battle-scarred trader is an individual who has been through the gauntlet of education courses and trading strategies only to come out disillusioned.</p>
            <p>Like me, they had faced similar struggles and challenges on their trading journeys, often feeling lost, frustrated, and unsure of where to turn for genuine guidance and support.</p>

            <p>Trading is not easy. It’s made infinitely more complex by a variety of factors. After over three decades of trading and spending thousands on trading courses and personally working with hundreds of traders, I’ve learned things you can only learn by trying, failing, and trying again.</p>
            <p>I want to share with you the seven pitfalls both aspiring traders and experienced traders make when aiming for long-term success.</p>
