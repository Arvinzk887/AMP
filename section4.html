			<h2>Chapter 3: The 7 Costly Pitfalls Preventing All-Market Trading Success</h2>
			<p>Trading is not easy. It’s made infinitely more complex by a
variety of factors.</p>
			<p>After over three decades of trading and spending thousands
on trading courses and personally working with hundreds of
traders, I’ve learned things you can only learn by trying, failing,
				and trying again.</p>
<p>I want to share with you the seven pitfalls both aspiring traders
and experienced traders make when aiming for longterm
	success.</p>
<p>I want to share these for two reasons:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>So that you can learn from these mistakes and avoid
				making them yourself.</li>
			<li>To show you why I’m passionate about using truly
non-directional “All-Market Profits” trading strategies to
protect and grow portfolios.</li></ol>
			<p>Some of these pitfalls may hit close to home. Others may
not seem relevant to you - yet. But, believe me, if you want
lasting success as an options trader, you need to be (at least)
cognizant of them all.</p>
<p>While the chapter is extensive, I believe the knowledge acquired
will be invaluable as you progress through this book
and work towards achieving consistent profitability in various
market conditions. Take the time to fully absorb the information
presented, as it will serve you well when applying
	the “All-Market Profits” framework in Part 2 of this book.</p>
<p>Let’s begin!</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>TRADER PITFALL #1: CHOOSING THE WRONG INFORMATION SOURCE</b></p>
			<p>As a non-professional trader trying to make your fortune
from your own home, choosing which information sources
you learn from is imperative for your education and your
				success. The problem?</p>
<p><strong>Most Sources Are Either Biased, Not Transparent, or
(worse) Unprofitable</strong></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Source #1: The Stock-Picking Media Machine</b></p>
		  <p>On the one hand, you have the “talking heads” on cable news
networks who offer an endless stream of (often conflicting)
stock-picking advice. These media personalities come with
an “impressive” resume from Wall Street top firms. They use
a mix of complex jargon and selective analysis to lead the
novice “return chasing” investor to believe their word for
		  gold.</p>
<p>In reality, their incentive is more aligned with padding their
ego and their companies’ wallets rather than dishing out
	credible investing advice.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the most notable television stock picker
of all, CNBC’s “Mad Money” host, Jim Cramer. Research
studies have shown that over 17+ years reviewed, Jim Cramer
has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 total return index both
	on an overall returns basis and in the Sharpe ratio.1</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s advisable to view these programs more as a
source of entertainment than as a reliable foundation for investment
education.2</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Source #2: The Wild West of Online Trading Educators or Gurus</b></p>
		  <p>The emergence of social media has ushered in a “Wild West”
of self-proclaimed trading and investment educators who
promise riches but aren’t actually profitable themselves.
These educators are more focused on selling the dream of
		  wealth than delivering actual, profitable trading strategies.</p>
<p>In fact, I believe (at least) 95% of the trading educators on
the internet are overhyped “snake oil” salesmen, grifters,
and con artists meant to hustle you out of your time and
hard-earned money. They, unfortunately, use slick, deceptive
advertising to prey on desperate people who want to
	“get rich quick” without effort.</p>
<p>I would know because I went on a crusade and publicly reviewed
30+ online trading courses on my YouTube channel.
On the channel, I investigate many of the well-known trading
gurus and their strategies in an effort to bring the best
trading strategies to light and to help the average consumer
avoid wasting their money and time. A few of these gurus
have threatened me with cease and desist letters and I’ve
even been sued.</p>
<p>Now, why would I spend my time researching and litigating
if I have my own strategies that work?</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Unselfish Reason: My mission is to add value and ensure
that you’re successful regardless if you decide to
learn with me or not. If I can help save you time, money,
				and effort by avoiding scams, I’ve done my job.</li>
				<li>Selfish Reason: I am fanatical about perfecting my trading
so if a person is touting a “better” strategy, I’ll investigate
to see if they do something I am not doing so
I can implement it myself. 99% of the time, I come up
empty-handed.</li></ul>
			<p>Here is what I found.</p>
			<p class="center-text">The #1 Way to Determine If An Educator is Legitmate</p>
		  <p>After devoting hundreds of hours to vetting other trading educators,
				I’ve determined:</p>
<p><strong><em>The only way to prove if an expert is credible and, more
importantly profitable, is to have them share their profit
and loss.</em></strong></p>
<p>Simply put, if a trading educator doesn’t show their real profit
and loss from a REPUTABLE brokerage account (ideally
accompanied with a screen recording of their transaction
history along with underlying trades), then why should you
	trust them?</p>
<p>Again, I believe that if an instructor makes promises in their
marketing, they should prove their credibility by sharing the
real P&amp;L of their entire portfolio on a consistent basis. Also,
	it’s helpful to see a profit and loss per underlying trade.</p>
<p><strong>So, why don’t educators share their P&amp;L if, by doing so,
they could immediately prove their credibility?</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>They Aren’t Profitable</strong> - Most trading educators simply
do not have a verifiable track record of profitability
				since inception.The instructor or trader will simply
“cherry pick” their winners and hide the losers - never
consistently sharing their verifiable portfolio P&amp;L. If they
do share their P&amp;L, it might only be a spreadsheet that
is easy to fudge, or they might not share their full account
			  statement since inception.</li>
<li><strong>It’s Easier to Sell Shovels in a Gold Rush</strong> - Selling online
courses can be likened to the Gold Rush where selling
tools (shovels) was often more profitable than searching
for gold itself. I’ll be the first to admit that selling educational
courses is a lucrative business model provided
the promises are upheld. The unfortunate reality is that
more educators are more skilled in marketing - not in
	trading - therefore, their promises are often not upheld.</li>
<li><strong>Common Sense Often Takes a Backseat When Greed
Enters the Picture</strong> - Emotions can cloud judgment when
the allure of quick profits is dangled before aspiring
traders. Educators exploit this by focusing on marketing
strategies that play into these emotions. This leads to
potential students ignoring the red flags, such as a lack
of transparency in profit and loss statements.</li>
		  </ul>
			<p>The broader implication here is pretty sobering: transparency
simply isn’t compatible with the business model of most
trading educators, yet it should be of paramount concern for
				the student.</p>
<p>Again, I implore you to do your own research. Reach out to
other educators and ask for their P&amp;L. You’ll be stunned by
the number of educators who flat out won’t share their statements
or will share only a snapshot of their accounts. Don’t
let their seemingly legitimate excuses fool you.</p>
			<p class="center-text">So... How Can You Find The Real P&amp;L of My Strategies?</p>
			<p>By now I hope you understand the importance of
verifying the performance of any trading strategy
or educator you follow. That’s why, since 2019, I
have been publicly sharing the net liquidation value
and “REAL P&amp;L” of my own trading accounts on
				my YouTube channel.</p>
<p>By posting regular updates, including weekly performance
reports, trade analyses, and educational
content, I aim to provide a clear, unfiltered view of
how the All-Market Trading Solution performs in real-
	time, across various market conditions.</p>
<p>While past performance is never a guarantee of future
results, I hope that this level of transparency
allows you, as a reader and potential student, to
assess the effectiveness and reliability of my strategies
yourself.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><strong>TRADER PITFALL #2: BELIEVING STOCK MARKET SUCCESS COMES FROM PREDICTING</strong></p>
			<p>How many investors or traders do you know who can accurately
pick the correct direction of a stock every time? I don’t
				know any.</p>
			<p>How about most of the time? I know very few.</p>
<p>No doubt, accurately predicting the future direction of a
	stock price movement will make an investor money.</p>
<p>The problem is that this “attempt at prediction” is an investor’s
	most challenging task and is akin to predicting the future.</p>
<p>Certainly, there is a very small minority of investors who
are highly skilled in fundamental analysis and/or technical
analysis insofar as they can accurately predict future price
movements, time their entries, properly manage their money
around these directional bets, and consistently outperform
	the market.</p>
			<p>I tip my hat to these individuals.</p>
<p><strong>But, for the majority of investors?</strong> Attempting to predict direction
is a losing proposition that can be summed up as
“coin flipping exercises,” where guessing the market if a
stock will go up or down is more akin to guessing if a coin
	toss will be heads or tails.</p>
<p>An analysis of the 5,292 trading days between 1996 and
2016 shows that the market was up 53.3% of the days and
	down 46.3% of those days.</p>
<p>If you need further proof, I highly recommend the book, A
Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Burton Malkiel. In his
book, Mr. Malkiel demonstrates that consistently predicting
	the future direction of stocks or assets has proven difficult.</p>
<p>This evidence further substantiates that even the world’s top
stock pickers, hedge funds, and money managers have difficulty
	beating the market’s returns</p>
<p><strong>So, what is the average person supposed to do if they wish
	to outperform the market?</strong></p>
<p>Stop believing the lie that stock market success comes from
predicting whether a stock will rise or fall.</p>
<p>The Achilles’ heel of most trading strategies is that they are
directionally dependent. With these strategies, the profits
and success lie in the trader or investor’s ability (or inability)
	to accurately predict the future.</p>
<p>A better approach is to turn your focus toward trading options
instead of stocks. Options (in general) can be a more
conservative and flexible investing vehicle where it is possible to construct strategies without the need to “time trades”
	or “predict” future price movements</p>
<p><strong>How This Applies to the A.M.P. Framework</strong></p>
<p>The A.M.P. trading strategies are all non-directional. In options,
  the term can be described as Delta-neutral - though a
  truly non-directional strategy is more than just Delta neutral
  as you’ll soon find out.</p>
<p>With a Delta-neutral strategy, the trader sets up a position
  where the Delta, which measures how much an option’s
  price moves in relation to the underlying asset’s price movement,
  is neutralized. Therefore, the strategy can profit despite
  the unpredictable nature of the stock market. You can
  mitigate the impact of price movements in the underlying
  asset while exploiting a statistical edge that options selling
  provides.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Quick Check-In</p>
			<p>As we wrap up this section of the chapter, I want to ask you thought-provoking questions:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>To what extent do your trading strategies focus
				on prediction over other analysis methods?</li>
				<li>How successful have you been in the past
with trades based on directional predictions?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Take a moment to honestly reflect on your answers.</p>
<p>If you can consistently and successfully predict
the future direction of a stock and manage money
based on those predictions, then you may not need
	the insights provided in this book.</p>
<p>However, if you find that your prediction-based
trades have yielded subpar results or if you’re
looking for a more reliable approach to navigate
the markets, then the principles outlined in Part 2
of this book can help you explore a less prediction-
dependent path to trading success.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>TRADER PITFALL #3: CHOOSING A TRADING STRATEGY WITH A LOW PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS</b></p>
			<p>By now, you hopefully know the antidote for cutting through
BS trading advice is rather simple - get a verifiable profit
and loss statement and/or backtested performance. In other
				words, no P&amp;L, no discussion.</p>
<p>This should eliminate 95% of the fake gurus online. Even
	then, our job is not done.</p>
<p>As with any type of investment, only some of the trading
strategies will be appropriate for your objective. A particular
strategy is “successful” only if it helps you meet your investment
	goals.</p>
<p>There are myriad ways to make money in the market, ranging
from buy-and-hold, day trading, and forex to stock options
and beyond. Whether they’re directional approaches
or not, there are and always will be people who will make
			particular strategies for them.</p>
<p>That said, even if someone is profitable does not mean that
their methods will work for you. Many people misjudge the
true likelihood of success in common trading methods.
Below I’ve listed why I think many of the “popular” trading
strategies are ill-advised (beyond the obvious answer that
	many of them are directional).</p>
			<p>The Perception Deception in Mainstream Trading Strategies</p>
			<p><b>The Data On Day Trading - Directional</b></p>
<p>The internet is rife with day trading experts peddling their
“magic wand indicators” and courses promising to unlock
the secret to windfall profits from only a few hours of daily
work. Yet, studies show that an astonishingly few day traders
can profit over time consistently, and those that do are
	extremely experienced and sophisticated -- not beginners.3</p>
<p>In fact, it is virtually impossible for an individual to day trade
for a living contrary to what brokerage specialists and course
providers often claim. Another study showed less than 1% of
the day trader population can predictably and reliably earn
	positive, abnormal returns net of fees.4</p>
			<p><b>Penny Stock Pump &amp; Dump - Directional</b></p>
<p>In my opinion, penny stocks are generally nothing less than
scams5. The truth is these stocks cost pennies for a reason,
nobody wants to buy them. Most pump-and-dump and “front
running” schemes happen with penny stocks, and there’s a
good chance that if you do buy penny stocks, you won’t be
able to find a seller for them when you want to get out. They
just don’t have enough volume. The odds of being able to
	trade penny stocks for a profit consistently are slim to none.</p>
			<p><b>Crypto Craziness - Directional</b></p>
<p>Just like penny stocks, cryptocurrency is a highly speculative
market fraught with insider trading, bogus training, and
thugs. The combination of extreme market volatility, security
vulnerabilities, and fraudulent activities, such as Ponzi
schemes and “rug pull” scams, can lead to substantial losses
for investors. The lack of robust regulation in this sector
leaves investors vulnerable and without recourse in cases
of theft or fraud - a case in point is the 2022 implosion of
popular Crypto exchange FTX and the subsequent guilt of
	founder Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
			<p><b>Forex Forays - Directional</b></p>
<p>If you’re considering trading FOREX, think again. Forex is
extremely unpredictable and unreliable because it’s based
	on governments and international relationships.</p>
<p>It doesn’t play by the same rules as the other financial instruments,
making it too risky for us. A study by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission of forex traders found that
70% of traders lose money every quarter on average, and
traders typically lose 100% of their money within 12 months.
A good rule of thumb is if you wanna lose your money, go
	into FOREX.</p>
			<p><b>Buying Options - Directional</b></p>
<p>Fueled partly by commission-free brokerages, Reddit users,
and Meme Stockholders, buying options have gained popularity
in the last few years. Small investors that buy options
are almost always net losers. Buying options is a nuanced
game of probabilities, and the odds are rarely on your side.
Not only do they have to be right directionally but the magnitude
of the move must exceed the expected move, which
rarely happens. Perhaps most importantly, when you buy
options, you fight time decay. The value of options decreases
	in value as time goes on (all else being equal).</p>
<p>Rationally speaking, buying options is like gambling. The casino
	is the one that makes the money, not the gambler</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, everyone loves a good story about how
someone “turned $10,000 into millions,” but the reality is
that a very (very) small percentage of people are successful
with the aforementioned strategies. Be cautious when an
educator touts about the very select few students who become
successful with their strategy and consider that many
of these companies sell 1000s of courses and only ~10 or so
students become successful. <strong>The odds are simply stacked
	against you when following the aforementioned strategies.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, you should ask yourself if the probabilities are
stacked in your favor that you will succeed with your trading
	or investing strategy.</p>
<p>Probabilities are everything when it comes to trading success,
and that is why I believe the only ways to make money
for a majority of retail investors are to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Buy and hold over a long period of time or…</li>
				<li>Sell option premiums.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><b>High Probability Strategy #1: Buy &amp; Hold</b></p>
			<p>If your financial goal over the long run is to have a decent
return with medium volatility — and you value the ability to
track the markets on a day-to-day basis closely — then lowfee,
				passive market-cap indices can be a great option.</p>
<p>The problem is in the term “over the long run.” Buy-and-hold
strategies tend only to work if you have a long time horizon
for investing. For example, had you invested in the S&amp;P 500
at the peak of the dot-com bubble in March of 2000, it would
have taken you up until 2014 to recover. Had you invested in
October 2007 (right before the Great Recession), you would
have had to wait five-and-a-half years to break even on your
	investment.</p>
<p>For buy-and-hold strategies, the best defense against significant
losses is simply having a long enough time horizon.
This doesn’t cut it for me because I don’t want to wait 5, 10,
or 15+ years for a substantial return and it shouldn’t cut it for
you either if your goal is to trade for a living, supplement
	your income, or bankroll your retirement.</p>
			<p><strong>High Probability Strategy #2: Selling Option Premium</strong></p>
<p>The best way for a majority of traders to make money is to
sell option premiums because of the edge it provides. I call
this the “Premiums Seller’s Edge.” If you are reading this, I
am assuming you know that there is a statistical edge in selling
options. If not, we will detail it further below.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>The Premium Seller's Hedge.</b></p>
			<p>PREMIUM SELLING is a term that means you sell
				more option premium than you buy.</p>
<p>In basic terms, selling option premiums is a lot like
selling insurance. Rationally speaking, no one buys
car insurance or health insurance to get rich.
Yet when investors buy options they are buying insurance
expecting to make money.</p>
<p>In reality, the ones making money are the insurance
companies, and by selling premiums, you’re
	turning yourself into an insurance company.</p>
			<p><strong>Selling Options (selling premiums) Has
		Three Distinct Advantages:</strong></p>
		  <p><strong>#1 Options Are Overpriced:</strong></p>
			<p>One of the main pricing components of an option
is Implied volatility (IV). Studies from the brokerage,
tastytrade, have shown that implied volatility
overstates realized volatility 75% of the time. This
means that the price of the options is HIGHER than
what they should be 75% of the time. Therefore,
options are “typically” overpriced. This imbalance
in options pricing presents opportunities for profit
extraction when you sell the options, offering a
	more reliable path to consistent gains.</p>
	<p><strong>#2 Time Is on Your Side:</strong></p>
<p>All options have one thing in common: they always
expire. In other words, they are depreciating
assets. Their value erodes as time passes. This is
known as Theta decay. Positive Theta (or benefiting
from the passage of time) can work IN YOUR
FAVOR by utilizing the best premium selling options
	strategies.</p>
	<p><strong>#3 The Probabilities Are in Your Favor:</strong></p>
<p>Selling options often have a higher probability of
profit compared to buying options. Option sellers
are taking on the role of an insurance provider for
other market participants. This means that the “win
rates” are higher.</p>
			<p>HOW THE ALL-MARKET PROFITS FRAMEWORK
				SOLVES FOR THIS:</p>
<p>At their core, the All-Market Profits (A.M.P.) strategies are
premium selling approaches that harness the inherent edge
options sellers have in the market. By focusing on high-probability
trades, the A.M.P. strategy aims to generate consistent
	profits across various market conditions.</p>
<p>A.M.P. strategies capitalize on the “Premium Seller’s Edge”
- the fact that implied volatility often overstates realized volatility,
leading to options being overpriced. This imbalance in
options pricing presents opportunities for profit extraction,
offering a more reliable path to consistent gains compared
	to directional strategies.</p>
<p>However, while high probabilities and win rates are essential
components of A.M.P. trading strategies, they are not the
sole determinants of success. As you’ll discover in the following
section, focusing exclusively on win rates can lead to
unforeseen risks and drawdowns.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>TRADER PITFALL #4: BELIEVING HIGH-WIN RATES &amp; RETURNS = SUCCESS</b></p>
			<p>Many traders (myself included) initially turn to selling options
due to the high win rates and statistical edge the approach
offers. High probability strategies, such as the traditional
wheel options strategy, selling credit spreads, or anything
recommended on tastytrade, might make you feel unstoppable,
				invincible, and overconfident, but there’s a trap.</p>
<p>High win rates might seem attractive, but they don’t necessarily
equal success. Theta decay is not necessarily your
	savior if one or two bad trades can wipe out your account.</p>
<p>I call this the 95% Win-Rate Trap.</p>
			<p>You may have even been here before. You’re trading along,
winning trade after trade, collecting your weekly paychecks
and making a killing at 30%-60%+ a year, thinking, “I cracked
the code.” Then, you continue to get more and more confident
and continue to leverage up without truly understanding
				the risk. But, what happens?</p>
<p>It’s what typically happens to many of the “high-win rate”
touting gurus. They proudly proclaim their 95% win rate
but conveniently omit the impact of market crashes. Market
crashes can and will wreak havoc on high-win rate portfolios,
	leading to significant drawdowns or unrecoverable losses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these gurus seldom address or even acknowledge
this critical aspect. Again a high win rate is a vanity
metric. This is why many traders liken selling premiums
to picking up pennies in front of a steamroller because one
bad trade can wipe out months or years of profit. They are
	often betting the empire for a pot of gold.</p>
			<p>The biggest impediment to building stock market wealth.</p>
<p>Similarly to prioritizing high-win rates, many traders also
	tend to prioritize high returns over high-risk-adjusted returns.
Outperforming isn’t just about achieving a higher percentage
of returns, it’s also about considering the amount of
risk you are taking. The real enemy of a trading system and
	profits is drawdowns.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett is famously quoted as saying: “The first rule
of an investment is don’t lose [money]. And the second rule
	of an investment is don’t forget the first rule.”</p>
<p>No seasoned investor or trader will ever argue with that logic.
However, it is worth including in this book because I don’t
think most traders and investors fully understand why drawdowns
are the biggest impediment to building stock market
	wealth.</p>
<p>As you probably know, a drawdown refers to the reduction
in the value of your investment account from its peak. It occurs
when your account value decreases, often due to market
losses or unfavorable trading decisions. Your portfolio is
	either making all-time highs or recovering from drawdowns.</p>
<p>Understanding drawdowns is vital because they directly affect
your portfolio’s performance and ability to recover from
	losses.</p>
			<p><b>Consider this example:</b></p>
			<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Drawdown% in Trading Capital</th><th>Return% to Get Back to Even</th>

			<ul>
				<li>If you experience a 10% drawdown, you need an 11%
				return to break even.</li>
				<li>With a 30% drawdown, you require a 43% return to recover.</li>
				<li>A 50% drawdown means you need a 100% return to getback to your starting point.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To put this in perspective, if a $100,000 portfolio suffers a
50% drawdown, it drops to $50,000. To return to $100,000,
a 100% return is needed - meaning you would have to double
				your account just to get back to breakeven.</p>
<p>For this reason, it’s important to mitigate drawdowns as
much as possible, as larger drawdowns require disproportionately
larger returns to recover - it becomes an uphill battle
	to regain your portfolio’s initial value.</p>
			<p><b>The True Cost of Drawdowns:</b></p>
<p>Managing a portfolio effectively means keeping drawdowns
to a minimum not only for the financial implications but also
for your emotional well-being. Severe drawdowns can lead
to irrational decision-making, overtrading, sleepless nights,
and heightened stress and anxiety. Heck! When I last blew
up my account in 2008, this “drawdown” plagued me with 5
	years of asthma.</p>
			<p><b>The Solution?</b></p>
<p><b>#1 - Learn How to “Properly” Diversify (Covered in the
	Next Section Along with Part 2 of This Book)</b></p>
<p>Many attempts to minimize drawdowns, such as traditional
diversification approaches, are often flawed. Each type of
market presents challenges that need to be addressed to
tame drawdowns.</p>
<p><b>#2 - Prioritize Risk-Adjusted Returns over Pure Returns
	When Determining a Strategy</b></p>
<p>If your goal is market outperformance, paying attention to
your return on risk is critical. If a portfolio gains 20% but experiences
a 60% drawdown, the returns are not as impressive.
The emphasis on capital preservation and maintaining
high-risk-adjusted returns are what separates the professional
from the non-professional trader. If you can keep your
drawdowns low and preserve your capital, you can continuously
	compound your returns.</p>
			<p><b>HOW THE A.M.P. SOLVES THIS:</b></p>
<p>Relying on high-win rates and returns without properly assessing
risk can lead to significant pain and emotional distress
in trading. By confronting these potential drawdowns
head-on and focusing on risk-adjusted returns and longterm
sustainability, you can develop a more robust and reliable
trading approach. The All-Market Profits framework, as
discussed in the upcoming chapters, prioritizes these key
factors to help you achieve consistent success while minimizing
	the pain of unexpected losses.</p>
<p>The only way to get low drawdowns is to weather all markets.
The only way I’ve found to weather all markets is with
non-directional options that are truly diversified (which we
will cover in the next pitfall).</p>

			<p class="center-text"><b>TRADER PITFALL #5: NOT BEING <em>TRULY</em> DIVERSIFIED</b></p>
			<p>The only free lunch in trading and investing is diversification
				- if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>This should be nothing new but in a broad sense, diversification
(aka your asset allocation model) is not just how you
manage risk, but it’s also the driving force behind your investment
returns. When you properly manage risk, you limit
	your drawdowns, and you get better returns.</p>
<p>But, the devil is in the details, and many common diversification
	models are flawed in my opinion.</p>
<p>Common Diversification Attempts For Traditional
	Investors</p>
<p>For many investors and money managers, the common diversification
approach is based on Modern Portfolio Theory
(MPT). MPT posits that an investor can maximize investment
returns while minimizing risk by considering the correlation
	between different assets.</p>
<p>Essentially, the goal is to create a “diversified” portfolio of
different uncorrelated asset classes (such as stocks, bonds,
etc.). When one draws down, the others make money.
Therefore, you’re aiming to create better risk-adjusted returns
compared to holding just one asset or just a couple of
assets. It’s important to note, however, that systematic risk,
which affects all investments (like risk arising from crashes
or recession), cannot be eliminated through diversification,
	according to common approaches that utilize MPT.</p>
			<p>Common Diversification Attempts For Option Investors</p>
<p>Now, for options traders, the concept of diversification takes
on a different twist. When selling options, there are many
“common” ways to diversify.</p>
			<p><strong>Diversify Across Different Underlyings:</strong> Go long or short on different uncorrelated underlyings
across different sectors. Place trades on different
			stocks, ETFs, commodities, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Diversify Across Different Strategies:</strong> Use different options strategies such as naked
puts, credit spreads, debit spreads, iron condors,
	traditional butterflies, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Diversify Across Different Time Periods:</strong> Some options traders will buy/sell long and
short-dated options with the goal of diversifying
their strategies across different events and time
	cycles.</p>
<p>Ultimately, many options traders “attempt” to diversify with
much complexity through many positions - resulting in a ton
of moving pieces that must be able to be properly managed
	and unwinded if unforeseen circumstances arise.</p>
<p>The Kryptonite</p>
<p>Regardless of the diversification, there is a kryptonite to
“common” diversification approaches. It’s what happened in
August of 2015. It’s what happened in February of 2018. It’s
	what happened during COVID. What is it?</p>
<p>Modern Crashes. With Modern Crashes, all assets become
correlated.</p>
			<p>Here is what happened from March
6 to March 19, 2020 COVID Crash
				Market:</p>
			<p>GLD (GOLD) -12.21%</p>
			<p>TLT (BONDS) -11.19%</p>
			<p>SPY (INDEX) -19.26%</p>
			<p>AAPL (TECH) -8.8%</p>
			<p>BA (DEFENSE) -62%</p>
			<p>TGT (RETAIL) -5.4%</p>
			<p>LUV (TRAVEL) -33%</p>
			<p>OXY (OIL) -60%</p>
			<p>AMGN (BIO) -6%</p>
			<p>This is called “crash correlation.”</p>
<p>Essentially, all assets are massively down while no asset
class appears safe. Why is this the case? The answer is leverage
and algorithms. There’s so much leverage in the system
that a small downturn can force deleveraging, and everyone
wants to be first to get out, so the algorithms trigger panic
selling. This panic selling causes a crash and a significant
volatility spike. This results in margin calls and forces one set
of assets to be sold in order to cover another set of assets.
	This means that no “normal asset” is safe.</p>
			<p>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE AVERAGE PORTFOLIO?</p>
<p>The way 99% of asset managers apply the “Modern Portfolio
Theory” breaks down due to this “systemic risk” because it
relies on at least one uncorrelated asset to cover the losses,
yet all normal assets in a crash are falling. This results
in excess losses, even with portfolios that are supposedly
uncorrelated. In other words, the supposed “diversification”
	turns into “diworsification.”</p>
<p>To be clear: it’s not that the theory itself doesn’t hold its
weight. It’s the way that almost every money manager applies
the theory. If I had most of my net worth invested in a
typical “Modern Portfolio Theory” based approach, I would
have trouble sleeping at night. That investment portfolio is
	too risky.</p>
			<p>What This Means For Options Sellers:</p>
<p>“Crash Correlation” not only affects traditional diversification
methods but also those who sell options. When your options
portfolio consists of multiple correlated positions, it effectively
becomes one large directional (short Vega) position,
leading to high drawdowns, losses, and potential margin
calls. That is not even including if the option seller has dozens
of positions that they have to manage, adjust, or unwind
	in a fast-moving market.</p>
			<p><b>What can be done?</b></p>
<p>The “secret” is to be long an asset that increases in value
during a crash. There’s only one way to be LONG a crash.
See, what everyone thinks they’re invested in is a diversified
basket of assets. But, despite what many pundits will have
you believe, there are only TWO asset classes. What they
are actually invested in is either short or long volatility.</p>
			<p>Long volatility is nothing new. Anyone can purchase protective
hedges (such as buying deep out-of-the-money puts).
				The problem with going long volatility is the cost.</p>
<p>Every long volatility hedge has a cost to maintain it. In other
words, the long volatility that will save your account when
the crash comes has a cost to overcome during the noncrash
periods. It is a tough balance to maintain, and most
	cannot do it.</p>
<p>However, as you will learn in the next few chapters when the
proper options trade structure is used and managed properly,
it is possible to create a more pure, predictable way to
diversify a portfolio that can effectively mitigate risk while
maximizing returns.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Let's recap the key points of this section and examine how All-Market Profits (A.M.P) strategies address these concerns:</p>
			<p><b>✓ We Need to Diversify:</b></p>
			<p>We cannot rely on traditional stock diversification
strategies to weather all markets, so we turn to
options. A.M.P. strategies harness “true diversification”
by employing strategically constructed
options structure that can be managed to perform
				well across various market conditions.</p>
			<p><strong>✓ We Need to Hedge against Tail Risk:</strong></p>
			<p>The primary purpose of a hedge is to protect capital
in a down market, particularly a market that is
crashing. The A.M.P. approach incorporates a proactive
hedging component to mitigate the impact
				of tail risk events on the overall portfolio.</p>
			<p><b>✓ It Needs to Be a Proactive Hedge:</b></p>
<p>During a crash, it’s too late to hedge. You may think
you want to go short some stocks or short the market,
but how do you know where the bottom is? As
you’ll uncover, the A.M.P. strategy emphasizes the
importance of having a proactive hedge in place
before market turbulence strikes.</p>
			<p><b>✓ It Needs to Be ‘Inexpensive’:</b></p>
			<p>The problem with long volatility is the cost - or the
drag on your portfolio. It can be difficult to justify
76
that cost when crashes may only occur once every
three to five years. The A.M.P. approach seeks
to optimize the cost-effectiveness of the hedging
component by strategically integrating it into the
overall options structure.</p>
			<p>In the upcoming chapters, we’ll dive deeper into the specific
components of the A.M.P. strategy and how they work
together to create a robust, all-weather approach to options
trading that aims to protect and grow your capital across all
market environments.</p>

			<p class="center-text"><b>TRADER PITFALL #6: OVER
RELYING ON DISCRETION,
EMOTIONS, &amp; SUBJECTIVITY</b></p>
			<p>One of the biggest account killers for most traders is improperly
managing the two biggest ‘emotions’ in trading:
				fear and greed.</p>
<p>Fear drives decisions that appear to avoid risk and generate
little return, while greed drives decisions that appear to be
	too risky.</p>
<p>As a result, common wisdom suggests you need to master
your “trading psychology” to be successful and profitable.
There are hundreds of books, college classes, and even
	performance coaches dedicated to this topic.</p>
<p><b>I believe trading psychology is hogwash…when you have
	a proper plan.</b></p>
<p>The truth is, when you have a proper trading plan in place,
	you can effectively remove emotions from your trading decisions.</p>
<p>A well-defined trading plan should tell you what to trade,
how and when to enter, how to manage your positions, and
how and when to exit. A better trading plan does all that
while also accounting for all market conditions. An ideal plan
is backtested, simple, 100% mechanical, has optimal position
sizing, creates time (not just money), and accounts for
	worst-case scenarios.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most “trading plans” taught online are subjective.
They might seem objective, but the educator typically
leaves just enough “gray area” for discretion and nuance.
This lack of clear, objective rules can lead to inconsistent
results, as emotions will inevitably take over. Subjective trading,
where rules are bent based on emotions and impulses,
	can be a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>To ensure consistent profits, it’s crucial to create a clear and
objective trading plan. Without a set of black-and-white rules,
maintaining consistency becomes a challenge. Remember,
success can only be consistent when the input – your trading
	decisions – is consistent.</p>
			<p><b>The Benefits of a Mechanical, Quantitative Investing Approach</b></p>
<p>A key reason for the success of the “All-Market Profits” strategies
method’s success lies in its emphasis on quantitative
trading. By relying on data-driven decision-making and objective
rules, traders can remove the subjectivity that often
leads to emotional trading. Quantitative investing allows for
a more mechanical, systematic approach to trading that is
	grounded in statistical analysis and historical data.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of a quantitative approach is the
ability to backtest strategies. Backtesting involves evaluating
a trading strategy’s performance using historical data,
which can help validate its effectiveness and identify potential
weaknesses. By relying on backtested strategies, traders
can have greater confidence in their trading plan and
	reduce the need for subjective judgment calls.</p>
			<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, most trading approaches can be divided into
two categories: Discretionary Trading and Systematic Trading.
Discretionary trading is more subjective and relies on
human judgment, while systematic trading is objective, relying
	on predefined rules.</p>
<p>In my opinion, relying on discretion, emotions, and subjectivity
is counterproductive for long-term trading success - especially
when first starting out. The All-Market Profits method
provides a powerful framework for achieving this goal,
offering a mechanical, rule-based approach that eliminates
the need for subjective decision-making. By adopting a
quantitative investing approach, backtesting strategies, and
adhering to a well-defined trading plan, traders can navigate
the challenges of emotional trading and achieve more consistent,
	profitable results.</p>
<p>As you progress through this book, you’ll learn more about
the specific components of the “All-Market Profits” Trading
Framework and how they work together to create a robust,
emotion-free trading system. By implementing these
principles and committing to a mechanical, rule-based approach,
you can take control of your trading performance
and achieve the long-term success you desire.</p>

			<p class="center-text"><b>TRADER PITFALL #7: Complexity
Fails, Simple Scales</b></p>
			<p>The last pitfall that many traders make is overcomplicating
				their strategy.</p>
<p>Options trading offers incredible flexibility, which can be
both a blessing and a curse. With hundreds of strategies and
thousands of variations, such as straddles, strangles, condors,
iron condors, butterflies, and iron butterflies, it’s easy
	to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices.</p>
<p>Take one look under the hood at option-selling portfolios
from traders at tastytrade or YouTube. You might see dozens
of positions at one time, each with its own unique risk
profile, expiration dates, management criteria, and capital
	requirements.</p>
<p>Seeing other people trade so many strategies simultaneously
can tempt both novice and experienced traders to create
a complex web of overcomplicated, over-diversified, and difficult-
	to-manage strategies in their own portfolios.</p>
<p>The allure of changing up strategies or trying new approaches
based on someone else’s successful P&amp;L can be strong.
However, this temptation can lead to overwhelm and can be
counterproductive to the primary goal of trading: creating
time, not just money. Most traders don’t have the luxury of
sitting in front of their computers all day actively managing
their accounts. Doing so would turn trading into another fulltime
job, which defeats the purpose of passively growing
	wealth.</p>
<p>Moreover, juggling an overcomplicated portfolio of different
positions and strategies not only requires more screen time
but also makes you more prone to making suboptimal management
decisions, especially during market downturns. In
options trading, making money relies not only on having a
great strategy but also on effectively managing that strategy
	when the market becomes volatile.</p>
<p>If you don’t fully understand how to manage all your strategies,
it can be particularly problematic in a highly volatile
crash environment. During these times, effectively managing
and unwinding all of your positions can be extremely difficult
and stressful, potentially leading to massive losses. I
learned this expensive lesson the hard way during the flash
crash of 2018 when I had to leg in and out of positions, wiping
	out months of gains.</p>
<p><b>My advice is simple: master simplicity before earning the
	right to complexity.</b></p>
<p>Avoid chasing “shiny objects” until you have mastered one
or two core strategies. Go a mile deep with your strategy
rather than a mile wide across dozens of “half-baked” strategies.
Remember, the real money in options trading comes
from how you manage your strategies. Don’t become a jack
	of all trades and a master of none.</p>
<p>Focus on developing a deep understanding of a simple, yet
effective strategy that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
By doing so, you’ll be better equipped to navigate
market volatility and make sound management decisions
when the time comes. As you gain experience and confidence,
you can gradually expand your repertoire, but always
prioritize mastery over complexity.</p>

			<p class="center-text">Score: 21-25 points</p>
			<p>Your trading approach seems to be highly complex and
time-consuming. While this may suit some experienced traders,
it’s essential to ensure that your trading aligns with your
overall goals and lifestyle. Consider streamlining your approach
to reduce stress and improve your trading efficiency.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Score: 13-19 points</p>
			<p>Your trading strategy appears to have a moderate level of
complexity and may require significant time commitment.
It’s important to assess whether this aligns with your trading
goals and personal preferences. If you find yourself struggling
to balance trading with other aspects of your life, consider
exploring ways to optimize your approach.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Score: 5-12 points</p>
			<p>Your trading approach seems to be relatively simple and
manageable, which can be a good foundation for long-term
success. However, it’s still important to ensure that your
				strategy is effective and aligned with your goals.</p>
<p>Regardless of your score, remember that the key to successful
trading is finding a strategy that works for you and aligns
with your goals, risk tolerance, and lifestyle. The following
chapters will provide valuable insights and tools to help you</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Key Chapter Takeaways</b></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Costly Pitfall #1: Choosing the Wrong Information
Source </strong>
			  <p>Understand the criticality of using credible and unbiased
			    sources for trading information. Avoid reliance on
			    media personalities and online trading gurus who may
			    not provide profitable advice. Think, “If their P&amp;L is not
			    real, what else are they trying to conceal?”</p>
			</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall #2: Believing Market Success Comes
from Predicting </strong>
  <p>Acknowledge the difficulty and unreliability of predicting
    stock movements. Focus on strategies that aren’t
    heavily reliant on market direction predictions, ones
    with a proven edge.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall #3: Choosing Low Probability Strategies </strong>
  <p>Emphasize the importance of selecting trading strategies
    based on their likelihood of success and alignment
    with investment goals. Be cautious of popular but
    low-probability trading methods. Instead, seek methods
    with probabilistic edges such as selling options.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall #4: Believing High-Win Rates = Success </strong>
  <p>Recognize that high-win rates do not guarantee overall
    trading success. Prioritize strategies that offer sustainable
    and risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, realize that
    drawdowns are the #1 impediment to long-term success.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall #5: Not Being Truly Diversified </strong>
  <p>Understand the limitations of traditional diversification
    methods, especially during systemic market downturns.
    Seek true diversification that can withstand market
    crashes by being long in the only asset that rises in a
    crash - volatility.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall #6: Remove Emotions &amp; Subjectivity </strong>
  <p>Stress the importance of removing emotional biases
    from trading decisions. Utilize a systematic, rule-based
    approach to ensure consistency in trading.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall #7: Simple Scales, Complexity Fails </strong>
  <p>Avoid chasing “shiny toy objects” until you master one
    or two core strategies. Go a mile deep with your strategy
    rather than a mile wide across dozens of “half-baked”
    strategies and remember that the real money with options
    trading is by how you manage your strategies!</p>
