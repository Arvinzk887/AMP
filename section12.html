			<h2>Chapter 7 point 4: Simplified Trade Entry &amp; Execution Principles</h2>
			<p>In the previous chapters, we’ve explored the essential components
of the All-Market Profits Trading Framework, including
the proactively hedged broken wing butterfly structure,
the advantages of using SPAN or Portfolio Margin, and the
importance of proper position sizing. With these foundational
elements in place, we now turn our attention to the critical
				aspect of trade execution.</p>
<p>Executing trades effectively is a crucial skill for any options
trader, as it directly impacts the overall performance and
profitability of a trading strategy. In this chapter, we’ll dive
into the concept of “campaign-style” trading, also known as
laddering trades. Additionally, we’ll discuss the importance
of using Single Ticket Orders when executing your trades, as
	this can help maintain Delta neutrality and reduce slippage.</p>
			<p><b>The Power of Campaign-Style Trading</b></p>
<p>One of the key risk management components of an All-Market
Profits type trading strategy is the concept of “campaign-
style” trading. Also referred to as laddering or layering
trades, campaign-style trading offers the ability to better
	diversify an options portfolio.</p>
			<p><b>What Is Campaign-Style Trading (Laddering Trades)?</b></p>
<p>Campaign-style trading involves placing trades over time or
at different periods based on a specific variable. Instead of
putting all your eggs in one basket and executing a single
large trade with however many contracts your position sizing
guidelines permit, you spread out your trades across different
	layers based on different timeframes.</p>
<p>This approach creates a campaign, an ongoing system of
layering in multiple trades to the portfolio that diversifies the
portfolio across time and volatility. This campaign method
helps diversify the risk aspects of any one individual trade
amongst the entire group and allows the “older” more established
trades to help hedge the “younger” more exposed
trades. It’s similar to the concept of “dollar cost averaging”
	we’re spreading out “risk” in an organized and orderly manner.</p>
<p>In order to best illustrate how to execute campaign-style
	trading, it’s first important to define key terms.</p>
			<p><b>Key Terms in Campaign-Style Trading:</b></p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> The collection or container of all your trades,
			  layers, or positions.</li>
<li><strong>Trade, Position, or Layer:</strong> These terms are used interchangeably
and refer to an individual position within
the portfolio. The term “layer” is used most often when
	referencing an individual position.</li>
<li><strong>Tranche:</strong> A pre-configured grouping or basket of several
different options contracts. One tranche is equivalent
to a specific number of contracts, such as 5 contracts in
the A.M.P. Structure.</li>
		  </ol>
			<p><strong>Building Blocks of an All-Markets “Campaign-Style” Options
			Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>A fully allocated portfolio can consist of any number of different
layers you choose based on your preference, capital,
etc. I typically break my full portfolio into four different layers.
Each layer represents an individual trade or position and is
	one-fourth of the maximum allocated capital for four layers.</p>
<p>The campaign-style trading approach involves staging the
entry of trades or layers over intervals of weeks to several
weeks. This means you start with an empty portfolio and
gradually add layers over time. Then, once the portfolio is
	fully allocated, you simply replace older layers with new layers.</p>
<p>For example, you might initiate your first trade or layer, and
a week or more goes by before you add another layer. You
continue this process, potentially holding onto previous layers
while waiting for them to hit profit targets or other exit
rules. A fully allocated portfolio would have all four layers
active at once, with no additional layers added beyond that
	point.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Campaign-Style Trading (Laddering
Trades):</strong></p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>Diversification Across Time:</strong> Laddering trades across
different time horizons offers several key benefits. First,
it can help smooth out your portfolio’s performance by
offsetting potential short-term losses with gains from
longer-term trades. Second, it reduces the impact of
market timing, as the success of your portfolio is less
dependent on the precise entry point of any single
trade. Finally, having traded with varying expiration
dates allows you to adapt quickly to changing market
			  conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Diversification Across Volatility:</strong> By placing trades at
different volatility levels, you can avoid having all your
eggs in one basket based on the volatility when the
trade was initiated. Because volatility tends to revert to
the mean, this can provide increased risk management.
Additionally, mature layers tend to have different profit
and risk profiles so they can help diversify the portfolio
	in certain markets.</li>
<li><strong>Negative Charm and Mature Structures:</strong> Campaignstyle
trading also takes advantage of the concept
of negative Charm, which is particularly beneficial
in grind-down markets. As the market grinds down,
the profit hump (or point of increasing profitability) of
mature structures grows larger due to negative Charm,
protecting the less mature structures in the portfolio.
The larger the profit hump and the more negative the
Delta, the more protection the mature structure offers
to the less mature structures in the portfolio.</li>
		  </ol>
			<p><b>TRADE EXECUTION PRINCIPLES:</b></p>
			<p>Beyond laddering my trades, I like to follow certain “trade
execution” principles when executing my All-Market Profits-
				type strategies.</p>
<p>Because the All-Market Profits 1-2-2 option structure broken
wing butterfly has multiple legs to the structure, I always aim
to place my trades using Single Ticket Orders.</p>
			<p><strong>What Is a Single Ticket Order?</strong></p>
<p>A Single Ticket Order involves putting on the entire position
with one order rather than breaking the trade into multiple
orders—commonly referred to as “legging in” and “legging
out.” Because the broken wing butterfly has multiple legs
in the structure, placing the trade on a single ticket simply
means ensuring all legs of the trade (the upper long, middle
short, and lower long) are all executed with one single limit
	order within the broker platform.</p>
<p>It is possible to manage an options portfolio without Single
Ticket Orders, but I prefer to avoid “legging in” and “legging
	out” of my positions for the following reasons:</p>
			<p><strong>Maintaining Delta Neutrality &amp; Reducing Slippage</strong></p>
<p>Recall one of my goals is to enter all of my positions with
Delta neutrality. If I were to execute my trade over several
orders, directional risk could creep in as the underlying
price can swing between the execution of each leg. If you
don’t keep your Deltas flat (or neutral) during this process,
the second leg order may need to be filled as soon as possible
just in case the market moves against you. When you are
rushed to execute an order, you usually get a bad fill, which
	means YOU lose money on slippage.</p>
			<p><strong>Good Til Canceled Profit Target</strong></p>
<p>Single Ticket Orders have a serious advantage over “legging
out” when you EXIT a position. With a multi-leg order
position, you need to track the point where you hit your profit
target. Only then do you take the trade-off. This moment of
opportunity may only occur for a short period of time. If you
	miss it, it may take days or weeks or never happen again.</p>
<p>When executing trades using Single Ticket Orders, you can
determine what price the position needs to fill in order to
hit your profit target. You can place the order right after you
enter the position. Just let the order sit with a Good Until
Cancel type order. Even if the profit target is hit for just an
instance, you don’t need to be present for the trade to execute.
I have seen my orders get filled and then watched the
market go right back to what would have been a non-profitable
price. There are those times when moments of liquidity
come into the market for a flash to fill your order.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Chapter Summary</b></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we focused on the critical aspect
of trade execution, introducing the concept of
“campaign-style” trading, also known as laddering
trades. Campaign-style trading involves spreading
out trades across different layers based on specific
timeframes, creating an ongoing system of diversifying
the portfolio across time and volatility.
Additionally, we emphasized the importance of using
Single Ticket Orders when executing trades to
maintain Delta neutrality and reduce slippage.</p>
