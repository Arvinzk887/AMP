			<h1>Part 2</h1>
			<h2>Chapter 7: The Option Selling Market
Types &amp; the Greeks</h2>
			<p>Before we dive into the heart of the All-Market Profits Trading
Framework, there’s one crucial aspect we need to first
address: understanding the interplay between market types
				and the option Greeks.</p>
<p>No options trading book is complete without discussing the
Greeks, and for good reason. Understanding the Greeks is
crucial for traders to manage risk exposure as market conditions
	change.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, we discussed how (on the surface) the key to
all market profits is to have a trade structure that is:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Positive Theta</li>
			<li>Flat Delta and Gamma</li>
			<li>Long Volatility (tamed Vega, long Vomma)</li>
			</ol>
		<p>Now, first-order Greeks, like Delta, Theta, and Vega, are essential to understand, but solely focusing on these metrics
alone is simply not enough to have a well-rounded trading
			strategy that can profit in all markets.</p>
<p>Typically, only paying attention to the first-order Greeks creates
a deceivingly directional situation. This is why traders
who only focus on the first-order Greeks can suffer drawdowns
and stress and subsequently don’t outperform the
	S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>Instead, the secret is understanding the influences of higher-
order Greeks such as Gamma, Charm, and Vomma. The
trick is piecing together a trade structure and a trade plan
that takes into account the four market types in conjunction
	with these higher-order Greeks.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I will detail as best I can why <b>accounting for
	the real hidden market forces (the higher-order Greeks) is</b>
the key to all market profits and how understanding these
market forces sets the stage for why the trade structure
you’ll learn in Chapter 7 can achieve performance in all market
	conditions.</p>
			<p><b>To accomplish this, I will:</b></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Recap the Option Selling Market Types that a truly
				non-directional trading system must navigate.</li>
<li>Then, I will review the relevant Greeks that I believe are
	essential to understand if you wish to trade non-directionally.</li>
<li>From there, I will return to an analysis of the four market
types that option sellers must contend with and show
you - with an understanding of the higher-order Greeks
- how you can set your trading up to overcome the challenges
each market type presents.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="center-text">AUTHOR'S NOTE;</p>
			<p>This chapter gets into the weeds. However, if you
wish to skip the theory, just remember that controlling
higher-order Greeks is the key to risk-adjusted
outperformance. The structure you’ll learn
in Chapter 7 is truly non-directional because it is
Theta positive, Delta and Gamma-neutral, and it
				mitigates Vega exposure while being long Vomma.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are new to trading and have no
idea what “the Greeks” are and if any of the topics
covered in this chapter feel over your head, then I
encourage you to go through my “Full Throttle Options
Mastery” course so you can get up to speed
on the foundational options concepts I reference in
this chapter and throughout this book:</p>

			<p><b>Understanding the Options Selling Market Types</b></p>
			<p>Before we dive into the Greeks, it is important to recap and
understand the four main options selling market types as
they relate to the overall market direction, trends, and volatility
levels. When I say market types, I refer to the S&amp;P 500
since I mainly trade options on the SPX and /ES.</p>
			<p>For option premium sellers, the market environment can be
broken down into four categories:</p>
			<table>
			<th>The Option Premium Selling Market Types</th>
			<tr>
				<td><b>1. The Rising Bull - Market Rises With Relatively Low
Volatility</b></td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>For the entire year of 2017, there
was a Rising Bull Market. The market
(S P X or S&amp;P 500 stock market) rose
over 19% while the highest VIX reading
					was under 17.5.</td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>2. The Sideways Market - Horizontal Range Bound
Price Action With Relatively Low Volatility (and occasional
tamed volatility spikes)</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>A Sideways Market occurred in the
first six months of 2015 when the
market stayed within a 4% range up
or down and the VIX high was slightly
above 23.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><b>3. The Grind-Down Market - A Falling Bear Market
With Tamed Volatility</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>A Grind-Down Market occurred from
October 1, 2018, through December
31, 2018, when the market was down
14.5% with a maximum VIX spike of
approximately 25 points.
Another occurred from January 1,
2022, through October 12, 2022,
when the market (S&amp;P 500) drew
down by -25.43%</td>
				</tr>
				<tr><td><b>4. The Crash Market - A fast bear market with a significant
spike in volatility.</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>A Crash Market occurred in August
2015 when the market dropped
13.13% in four days and the VIX went
from 15 to over 53, a 38-point spike.
Another Crash Market occurred in
early February 2018 when the market
fell over 10.5% in seven days and
the VIX went from 12.5 to over 50 in
four days.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The key to long-term trading wealth is to have a trade structure
and plan that preserves and grows your capital in all
				these market environments.</p>
<p>Each of these market types presents unique challenges for
options traders, and understanding how the Greeks behave
in each environment is crucial for success.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>The Greeks</b></p>
			<p>Now, let’s turn our focus to briefly defining the first-order
Greeks - Delta, Theta, and Vega - which form the foundation
of options trading as well as the higher-order Greeks, such
as Gamma, Charm, and Vomma.</p>
			<p>First-Order Greeks: The Foundation
The first-order Greeks - Delta, Theta, and Vega - form the
foundation of options trading. Here’s a brief overview of
				each and how it relates to the A.M.P. 1-2-2 Structure:</p>
			<p><b>Theta:</b> Represents the rate of time decay of an option. This
is one of our edges. Premium sellers benefit from the passage
of time (all else being equal) - this is “Theta decay.” To
capitalize on this edge, we want to be Theta-positive, which
helps weather all market types except for crashes. In a crash,
another Greek (Vomma) takes over to make the trade structure
				profitable.</p>
			<p><b>Delta:</b> Represents the sensitivity of an option’s price to
changes in the value of the underlying security. If Delta is
not accounted for, you risk becoming directional and won’t
be able to fully take advantage of Theta decay. Our goal is
to be Delta-neutral to remove directional risk, meaning the
market moving up or down has little effect on the P&amp;L as
far as Delta is concerned. Delta neutrality helps weather all
				market types except for crashes.</p>
			<p><b>Vega:</b> Represents an option’s sensitivity to volatility. If you
are positive Theta, you are typically forced to be negative
Vega - meaning that as volatility increases, the P&amp;L will decrease
- this is a trade-off that we have to manage. Without
fully understanding Vega, you could make irrational trading
decisions. We aim to mitigate the effects of Vega across all
				market types.</p>
			<p><b>The A.M.P. 1-2-2 option structure</b> leverages these first-order
Greeks to create a more balanced and less directional
trade. By carefully selecting the strikes and expiration dates,
this structure can minimize the impact of Delta while benefiting
				from Theta decay and managing Vega risk.</p>
			<p>Higher-Order Greeks: The Hidden Market Forces</p>
<p>While many options traders focus solely on the first-order
Greeks, the real secret to success lies in understanding the
influences of higher-order Greeks, such as Gamma, Charm,
	and Vomma.</p>
			<p><b>Gamma:</b> Represents the rate of change of Delta. Delta can
be neutral, but price movements can still hurt you. Gamma-
neutral trades maintain a stable Delta even when the
underlying asset’s price changes, creating stability for every
market type (except for crashes). Furthermore, if you’re Gamma-
neutral, you can mitigate the effects of negative Vega
				because volatility expansions eventually revert to the mean.</p>
			<p><b>Charm:</b> Measures the rate of change of an option’s Delta
concerning time. I think of Charm as the future “personality”
of Delta and it needs to be taken into account to fully optimize
a non-directional trade plan. We want negative Charm
because our risk is to the downside. Negative Charm means
that the Delta of the position will become more negative
over time. This means if the market goes down, the position
				is making money based on negative Delta.</p>
			<p><b>Vomma:</b> Measures the sensitivity of an option’s Vega to
changes in the implied volatility of the underlying asset.
There’s only one asset guaranteed to rise in a market crash
- volatility. By being positive Vomma, our trade structure can
				potentially make money during crashes.</p>
			<p><b>The A.M.P. 1-2-2 option structure</b> takes advantage of these
higher-order Greeks to create a truly non-directional trade.
By being Theta-positive, Delta and Gamma-neutral, having
negative Charm, and being positive Vomma, this structure is
designed to weather all market types and potentially profit
during crashes.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Piecing it All Together: Understanding the Greeks in Different Market Types</b></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve explored why success in options trading is
contingent on not only an understanding of the first-order
Greeks but also a deep appreciation for the higher-order
Greeks, it’s time to switch gears and examine how these factors
				interact with various market conditions.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we’ll examine the Greeks through
the lens of the four primary options selling market types with
an emphasis on showcasing how the A.M.P. 1-2-2 trading
	structure can weather each.</p>
			<p>Controlling the Greeks for Bull Market Performance</p>
<p>The way the structure does well in a bull market is by controlling
	the following Greeks:</p>
			<p><b>Delta:</b> If Delta is controlled, then the market’s movement upward
				effect on P&amp;L can be better mitigated.</p>
			<p><b>Gamma:</b> Gamma is a second-order Greek. If Gamma is flat (or
neutral) with the structure, then the market’s movement-up
effect on P&amp;L can be better mitigated. I think of Gamma as
the curvature of the T plus 0 line in a risk graph.</p>
			<p><b>Theta:</b> Now, the position also carries positive Theta, which
creates profit over time as the position has sold depreciating
assets. This creates what I call positive headroom. Positive
headroom simply means that the T+0 Line is lower than the
next T+X Line coming up in time. With positive headroom,
the position’s P&amp;L is expected to increase in value over time
all else being equal.</p>
			<p><b>Vega:</b> This positive Theta brings volatility risk to the trade,
as Vega is negative. However, volatility does not typically
				increase in an underlying that climbs higher in a bull market.</p>
			<p><b>Charm:</b> If you’re an experienced options trader, you should
be thinking that neutral Delta and neutral Gamma mean
very little risk but also mean a lower chance for profit. This
is where a second-order Greek, Charm, comes into play.
The goal of a truly non-directional trade structure with more
downside than upside risk is to have negative Charm, which
means that, over time, a downside profit hump builds as the
T+0 Line rises over time and eventually catches up to the
underlying price in an up market.</p>
			<p>Controlling the Greeks for Sideways Market Performance</p>
<p>Next, I’ll get into the sideways market. A sideways market is
characterized by the underlying asset trading within a relatively
tight range, with occasional volatility spikes. This type
of market is really like a bull market on steroids for the “Proactively
	Hedged Long Put Broken Wing Butterfly.”</p>
<p>All the reasons a truly non-directional option strategy makes
money in a bull market are the same for a sideways market,
except profits can happen much faster as the negative
Charm builds the profit hump and has less room to travel for
the structure to make money. The depreciation of the options sold brings a truly non-directional strategy to profit and
	does so faster than in a bull market.</p>
<p>The “Proactively Hedged Long Put Broken Wing Butterfly”
structure excels in this environment by leveraging the following
	Greek exposures:</p>
			<p><b>Delta and Gamma:</b></p>
<p>The structure maintains a Delta-neutral position, ensuring
that small price fluctuations within the range have minimal
impact on the overall P&amp;L. The flat Gamma exposure further
reinforces the structure’s stability, as the Delta remains relatively
unchanged, even as the underlying price moves within
the range. This allows the trade to profit from time decay
without being significantly affected by minor price movements.</p>
			<p><b>Theta:</b></p>
			<p>In a sideways market, the structure’s positive Theta exposure
becomes even more advantageous. As time passes, the
option positions in the structure decay in value, generating
consistent profits for the trader. The longer the market
remains range-bound, the more the trade benefits from
				Theta decay.</p>
			<p><b>Vega:</b></p>
<p>Although the structure has a negative Vega exposure, the
impact of volatility changes in a sideways market is typically
less pronounced compared to other market conditions.
The occasional volatility spikes may temporarily affect the
trade’s P&amp;L, but the overall impact is mitigated by the structure’s
	balanced design and the positive Theta exposure.</p>
			<p><b>Charm:</b></p>
<p>The negative Charm exposure plays a crucial role in a sideways
market. As time progresses, the negative Charm causes
the downside profit hump the ability to reach the current
market price compared to a bull market. This means that
the trade can achieve profitability faster, even with minimal
movement in the underlying asset’s price. The structure’s
design takes advantage of this negative Charm, allowing it
	to generate profits more efficiently in a range-bound environment.</p>
			<p>Controlling the Greeks for Grind-Down Market Performance</p>
<p>Grind-down markets pose significant challenges for options
sellers. A grind-down market is characterized by a slow, persistent
decline in the underlying asset’s price, often accompanied
by moderate volatility levels. A notable example is
the fourth quarter of 2018 where volatility, as measured by
the VIX, rose to 36 and the S&amp;P 500 declined by 20%. This
	scenario also unfolded throughout 2022.</p>
<p>In such markets, the underlying price often falls below the
	3% to 7% buffer zone where Delta and Gamma are neutral.</p>
<p>Another typical feature of market downturns is an increase
in volatility.</p>
			<p>A truly non-directional strategy copes with grind-down markets
by adapting to the aftermath of the initial drop. After
the initial volatility shock stabilizes, the Vega in the position
begins to recuperate the P&amp;L as the negative Vega climbs
back towards neutrality. Moreover, as the underlying price
approaches the peak of the profit hump which builds to the
				downside, the strategy benefits.</p>
<p>It’s not only vital to keeping Delta under control but also to
give the structure time to build a profit hump, which is crucial
for protecting profits in a Grind-Down Market.</p>
			<p>The “Proactively Hedged Long Put Broken Wing Butterfly”
structure navigates this challenging environment by controlling
				the following Greeks:</p>
			<p><b>Delta and Gamma:</b></p>
<p>As the market grinds down, the structure’s Delta exposure
may shift slightly positively. However, the proactive hedging
component and the careful strike selection help to maintain
a relatively neutral Delta overall. The flat Gamma exposure
ensures that the Delta remains stable, preventing the trade
	from becoming overly directional as the price declines.</p>
			<p><b>Theta and Vega:</b></p>
<p>In a grind-down market, the positive Theta exposure continues
to generate profits as time passes, offsetting some
of the losses incurred from the increase in the underlying’s
volatility. However, the negative Vega exposure becomes
a more significant concern as volatility tends to increase
during market declines. To manage this risk, the structure’s
downside profit hump helps to mitigate the impact of rising
	volatility on the trade’s P&amp;L.</p>
			<p><b>Charm and Vomma:</b></p>
<p>The negative Charm exposure accelerates the buildup of
the downside profit hump, allowing the trade to achieve
profitability more quickly as the market grinds down. This is
particularly beneficial in a grind-down market, as it helps to
offset the losses from the increase in the underlying volatility.
Additionally, the careful management of Vomma, which
measures the rate of change of Vega concerning volatility,
helps to optimize the trade’s performance during periods of
	elevated volatility.</p>
			<p>Controlling the Greeks for Crash Market Performance</p>
<p>The final market scenario to consider is the Crash Market,
characterized by the underlying price dropping 3%-7% beyond
the flat Gamma point. The speed at which a crash occurs
is a critical distinction between a grind-down market
	and a crash.</p>
<p>Notable examples of single-day crashes include August 24,
2015, and February 5, 2018. March 2020 presented a different
	situation with multiple consecutive crashes.</p>
<p>Truly non-directional option structures manage crashes by
initially drawing down with the market but then capitalizing
on Vomma. As the underlying volatility rises significantly,
Vomma influences P&amp;L above all other Greeks. I call this a
	“Vega Flip.”</p>
<p>Profit generation in crash scenarios hinges on Vomma, which
denotes the exponential increase in Vega. This second-order
Greek plays a critical role in the strategy’s effectiveness
	during market crashes.</p>
<p>The key is to have proactive hedges in place against market
crashes.</p>
			<p><b>Delta, Gamma, and Theta:</b> During a market crash, the structure’s
Delta exposure may temporarily shift to a more positive
value as the rapid price decline pushes the trade towards
a more directional exposure. However, the proactive
hedging component and the strategic strike placement help
to mitigate the impact of this sudden shift in Delta. The Gamma
exposure, while relatively flat, may experience temporary
fluctuations due to the extreme price movement. The positive
Theta exposure, although still present, becomes less
				effective in generating profits during a sharp market decline.</p>
			<p><b>Vega and Vomma:</b></p>
			<p>This structure has negative Vega exposure and therefore,
if the market draws down 3-7%, this structure will also draw
down. However, when a market crash occurs, these hedges
will begin to activate and this negative Vega will begin to
flip. When volatility continues expanding, Vomma (the exponential
part of Vega) will begin to kick in and a Vega Flip will
occur. Then, because this structure is long volatility through
the proactive hedges, the P&amp;L of the structure will get into
the positive. Therefore, in Black Swan events, this trade
				structure can do quite well because of these hedges.</p>
			<p><b>Charm:</b></p>
<p>In a crash market, the mature negative Charm profit hump
provides a potential buffer against the initial rapid price decline
and volatility increase of the underlying. The effectiveness
of Charm in generating profits during a crash market
may be limited due to the extreme nature of the volatility
	expansion.</p>
			<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Many traders overlook the significance of higher-order
Greeks, which are essential for managing the more familiar
	first-order Greeks, like Vega, Theta, and Delta.</p>
<p>The “Proactively Hedged Long Put Broken Wing Butterfly”
(A.M.P. 1-2-2) option structure’s ability to control the Greeks
across different market conditions is the key to its success
in generating consistent profits and mitigating losses across
	all market conditions.</p>
<p>By maintaining a neutral Delta and flat Gamma profile, benefiting
from positive Theta exposure, managing negative
Vega risk, and leveraging negative Charm and Vomma exposures,
the 1-2-2 structure can adapt to the unique challenges
	presented by each market type.</p>
<p>As we move into Part 2 of this book, the upcoming chapters

Profits Trading Framework, providing a detailed, systematic
approach to building a robust options trading portfolio. You
will learn the specifics of the optimal trade structure, position
sizing, trade execution, and management techniques

				<li>Charm measures the rate of change of an option’s
Delta concerning time, and negative Charm is desirable
to optimize the trade plan.</li>
				<li>Vomma measures the sensitivity of an option’s
Vega to changes in implied volatility, and being
positive Vomma allows traders to potentially profit
during crashes.</li>

			<li><b>The “Proactively Hedged Long Put Broken Wing Butterfly”
structure harnesses the Greeks to create a truly
non-directional trade</b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>The structure takes advantage of higher-order
Greeks to create a more balanced and adaptable
options trading approach.</li>
				<li>By being Theta-positive, Delta and Gamma-neutral,
having negative Charm, and being positive Vomma,
this structure is designed to weather all market
types and potentially profit during crashes.</li>
				<li>While the structure provides a robust foundation
for non-directional trading, it must be adapted and
optimized to account for varying market conditions,
volatility levels, and individual trader goals.</li>
