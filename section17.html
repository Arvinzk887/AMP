			<h2>Chapter 10: Continuing Your Options Trading Education</h2>
			<p>Introduction</p>
<p>As the old adage goes, “The only constant in life is change.”
This couldn’t be more true when it comes to trading. The
markets are constantly evolving. New challenges arise, strategies
come in and out of favor, and what worked yesterday
	may not work tomorrow.</p>
<p>In this dynamic landscape, continuous learning is the key
to long-term success as an options trader. It allows you to
adapt to new challenges, refine your strategies, and maintain
	your competitive edge.</p>
<p>Throughout my own three-decade journey as an options
trader, I’ve witnessed firsthand the importance of ongoing
education. From the early days of online trading to the explosion
of online resources, I’ve had to continually update
my knowledge and skills to stay competitive. Along the way,
I’ve also encountered my fair share of “bad actors” – educators
and gurus who overpromise, underdeliver, and often
	leave their students worse off than when they started.</p>
<p>These experiences have inspired me to write this chapter
and share with you the lessons I’ve learned about continuing
your options trading education effectively and responsibly.
Central to this effort is a “15-step checklist” I’ve developed
	for evaluating trading educators and courses.</p>
<p>How to Approach Continued Education with a Critical
	Lens</p>
<p>Born out of my own trials and errors and my work reviewing
numerous trading programs on my YouTube channel, this
checklist is designed to help you navigate the often confusing
landscape of trading education and make informed
	decisions about who to learn from.</p>
<p>As you seek out new learning opportunities, these questions
can guide you to find the right educator to support your ongoing
growth as a trader.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s dive into each question and explore why it matters.</strong></p>
			<table>
			<th class="center-text">The 15-Step Trading Course Audit &amp; Checklist</th>
			<tr>
				<td>Transparency and Credibility</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> Do you share your portfolio
P&amp;L?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>A transparent educator should be willing to share their
real portfolio performance, including profits and losses.
Don’t trust self-reported numbers. Ensure they share
their real net liquidation value and snapshots/video recording
of their trade history from a reputable broker.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> Do you share all the trades
made in your account as you trade them
with real money?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Full transparency in real-time trade reporting is a sign
of an educator’s confidence and integrity. While not always
possible due to compliance or other reasons, real-
time trade sharing can provide valuable learning opportunities.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> What kind of return should I
expect if I follow?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Be wary of educators who promise unrealistic returns or
guarantee profits. A responsible educator should provide
a range of reasonable expectations based on historical
data and real-world performance.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Strategy Evaluation</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> What is the edge? Is the edge
explained?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Every successful trading strategy must have an edge
– a unique advantage that sets it apart from other approaches.
Ask the educator to clearly define their edge
and explain how it helps generate consistent profits.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> Do you recommend buying
option premium or placing low-probability
trades?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Buying option premium or placing low-probability trades
can be risky, especially for beginners. Be cautious of
educators who heavily promote these approaches without
a strong emphasis on risk management.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> Is the strategy directional?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>As we’ve discussed throughout this book, non-directional
trading strategies can be more adaptable and effective
in various market conditions. Consider whether the
educator’s system relies heavily on predicting market
direction.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="center-text"><strong>System Evaluation</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> Have you backtested or forward-
tested the system in all market conditions?
Including grind-down and crash
scenarios?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Backtesting and forward-testing are essential for validating
the performance of a trading strategy. Ask the
educator for detailed results of their testing process, including
the methodology and time periods used.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> Does the educator trade with
objective rules?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>A well-defined, rule-based trading system is crucial for
consistency and reducing emotional decision-making.
Look for educators who emphasize objective rules and
provide clear guidelines for trade entry, management,
and exit.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> Does the trade plan take into
account commissions and slippage?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Realistic trading plans should factor in the costs of commissions
and slippage, as these can significantly impact
overall profitability. Be cautious of educators who ignore
or downplay these costs.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="center-text"><strong>Risk Management</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> In backtests, were there drawdowns?</td>
				<td><strong>[Answer]</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Every trading system will experience drawdowns – periods
of losses or declines in account value. Ask the
educator about the maximum drawdowns encountered
during backtesting and how they plan to manage and
mitigate these risks.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> What is the highest margin
requirement allowed in the trade plan?</td><td><strong>[Answer]</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Understanding the margin requirements of a trading
strategy is essential for risk management and capital
allocation. Ask the educator about the maximum margin
requirements and ensure they align with your risk tolerance
and account size.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="center-text"><strong>Likelihood Of Success</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> What is the likelihood of success
for students following your approach?
Are there already students with
results or is it only you?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><p>An unfortunate industry secret is that many educators
will have 1000s of customers yet they will only tout the
success of 10 or so students. Those are great odds. Always
request real case studies and success stories from
past students to gauge the realistic chances of success
with the educator’s program.</p>
					<p>This underscore the importance of evaluating the educator’s
track record in producing successful students.
By requesting real case studies and success stories,
you can gain valuable insights into the educator’s effectiveness
and the likelihood of achieving your desired
outcome.</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td class="center-text"><strong>Additional Considerations</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> Is the trading system tax-advantaged?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Certain trading strategies, such as those focused on index
options like SPX, may offer tax advantages. Consider
whether the educator’s system takes advantage of
these benefits, which can help optimize your after-tax
returns.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> Do I need to be in front of my
computer most or all of the day to trade
the system?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>A trading system that requires constant monitoring or
frequent intraday actions may not be suitable for everyone.
Consider your lifestyle and time constraints when
evaluating an educator’s approach.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><strong>Question:</strong> Is the course proprietary?</td><td><strong>Yes or No</strong></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>A proprietary course is one that teaches original, unique
strategies developed by the educator. While not essential,
a proprietary course may offer valuable insights
and techniques not found elsewhere.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Now that you understand the significance of each question,
let’s explore how to use them effectively when evaluating
potential educators or courses.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Research the educator’s background and credentials.
Look for verifiable track records, professional certifications,
				and industry experience.</li>
				<li>Review the educator’s course materials, including any
available syllabus, sample content, or testimonials from
					past students.</li>
				<li>Schedule a consultation or attend a free webinar to get
					a feel for the educator’s teaching style and approach.</li>
				<li>Ask the 15 questions during your consultation or via
					email, and carefully assess the educator’s responses.</li>
				<li>Compare the educator’s answers to your own trading
					goals, risk tolerance, and learning preferences.</li>
				<li>Trust your instincts – if something feels “off” or too good
					to be true, it probably is.</li>
				<li>Remember “proof is in the pudding - If a trading educator
gives excuses for not sharing their real P&amp;L and
verifiable track record of results (such as it being an
income claim), then walk away. Showcasing verifiable
past performance and brokerage statements does not
constitute an “income claim” so long as it is substantiated
and properly disclosed. Many fake gurus use the
“income claim” excuse as a reason to not show their
					lackluster results.</li>
				<li>Remember, the goal is to find an educator who aligns
with your values, provides transparent and verifiable results,
and offers a comprehensive, well-tested trading
approach. Don’t be afraid to ask tough questions and
walk away if an educator fails to meet your standards.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Conclusion</p>
			<p>As you continue your options trading education, remember
that the key to long-term success lies in continuous learning,
adaptability, and a commitment to your own growth. Using
the 15 questions provided in this chapter as a buyer’s guide,
you’ll be well-equipped to navigate the often-confusing
landscape of trading education and find the educators and
resources that align with your goals.</p>
