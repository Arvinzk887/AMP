			<h1>Part 2</h1>
			<h2>Chapter 6: The Option Selling Market
Types &amp; the Greeks</h2>
			<p>Before we dive into the heart of the All-Market Profits Trading
Framework, there’s one crucial aspect we need to first
address: understanding the interplay between market types
				and the option Greeks.</p>
<p>No options trading book is complete without discussing the
Greeks, and for good reason. Understanding the Greeks is
crucial for traders to manage risk exposure as market conditions
	change.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, we discussed how (on the surface) the key to
all market profits is to have a trade structure that is:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Positive Theta</li>
			<li>Flat Delta and Gamma</li>
			<li>Long Volatility (tamed Vega, long Vomma)</li>
			</ol>
		<p>Now, first-order Greeks, like Delta, Theta, and Vega, are essential to understand, but solely focusing on these metrics
alone is simply not enough to have a well-rounded trading
			strategy that can profit in all markets.</p>
<p>Typically, only paying attention to the first-order Greeks creates
a deceivingly directional situation. This is why traders
who only focus on the first-order Greeks can suffer drawdowns
and stress and subsequently don’t outperform the
	S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>Instead, the secret is understanding the influences of higher-
order Greeks such as Gamma, Charm, and Vomma. The
trick is piecing together a trade structure and a trade plan
that takes into account the four market types in conjunction
	with these higher-order Greeks.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I will detail as best I can why <b>accounting for
	the real hidden market forces (the higher-order Greeks) is</b>
the key to all market profits and how understanding these
market forces sets the stage for why the trade structure
you’ll learn in Chapter 7 can achieve performance in all market
	conditions.</p>
			<p><b>To accomplish this, I will:</b></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Recap the Option Selling Market Types that a truly
				non-directional trading system must navigate.</li>
<li>Then, I will review the relevant Greeks that I believe are
	essential to understand if you wish to trade non-directionally.</li>
<li>From there, I will return to an analysis of the four market
types that option sellers must contend with and show
you - with an understanding of the higher-order Greeks
- how you can set your trading up to overcome the challenges
each market type presents.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="center-text">AUTHOR'S NOTE;</p>
			<p>This chapter gets into the weeds. However, if you
wish to skip the theory, just remember that controlling
higher-order Greeks is the key to risk-adjusted
outperformance. The structure you’ll learn
in Chapter 7 is truly non-directional because it is
Theta positive, Delta and Gamma-neutral, and it
				mitigates Vega exposure while being long Vomma.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are new to trading and have no
idea what “the Greeks” are and if any of the topics
covered in this chapter feel over your head, then I
encourage you to go through my “Full Throttle Options
Mastery” course so you can get up to speed
on the foundational options concepts I reference in
this chapter and throughout this book:</p>

			<p><b>Understanding the Options Selling Market Types</b></p>
			<p>Before we dive into the Greeks, it is important to recap and
understand the four main options selling market types as
they relate to the overall market direction, trends, and volatility
levels. When I say market types, I refer to the S&amp;P 500
since I mainly trade options on the SPX and /ES.</p>
			<p>For option premium sellers, the market environment can be
broken down into four categories:</p>
			<table>
			<th>The Option Premium Selling Market Types</th>
			<tr>
				<td><b>1. The Rising Bull - Market Rises With Relatively Low
Volatility</b></td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>For the entire year of 2017, there
was a Rising Bull Market. The market
(S P X or S&amp;P 500 stock market) rose
over 19 percent while the highest VIX reading
				was under 17 point 5.</td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>2. The Sideways Market - Horizontal Range Bound
Price Action With Relatively Low Volatility (and occasional
tamed volatility spikes)</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>A Sideways Market occurred in the
first six months of 2015 when the
market stayed within a 4 percent range up
or down and the VIX high was slightly
above 23.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><b>3. The Grind-Down Market - A Falling Bear Market
With Tamed Volatility</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>A Grind-Down Market occurred from
October 1, 2018, through December
31, 2018, when the market was down
14 point 5 percent with a maximum VIX spike of
approximately 25 points.
Another occurred from January 1,
2022, through October 12, 2022,
when the market (S&amp;P 500) drew
down by negative 25 point four three percent</td>
				</tr>
				<tr><td><b>4. The Crash Market - A fast bear market with a significant
spike in volatility.</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>A Crash Market occurred in August
2015 when the market dropped
13 point one three percent in four days and the VIX went
from 15 to over 53, a 38-point spike.
Another Crash Market occurred in
early February 2018 when the market
fell over 10 point five percent in seven days and
the VIX went from 12 point 5 to over 50 in
four days.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The key to long-term trading wealth is to have a trade structure
and plan that preserves and grows your capital in all
				these market environments.</p>
<p>Each of these market types presents unique challenges for
options traders, and understanding how the Greeks behave
in each environment is crucial for success.</p>
