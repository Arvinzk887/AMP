			<h2>Chapter 5: The Problem with a Truly Non-
Directional “All-Market Profits”
Trading Strategy</h2>
			<p>In the previous chapters, we explored the numerous benefits
of employing a truly non-directional trading strategy, culminating
in the introduction of the proactively hedged broken
wing butterfly as the cornerstone options structure for
all-market profitability. Looking forward to Part 2 of this book,
I will reveal the exact blueprint and methodology, including
the constructions, position sizing, entry, and management
guidelines. Packaged together, this forms the basis of a Truly
Non-Directional Trading Strategy – or the All-Market Profits
				Framework.</p>
<p>While a truly non-directional trading strategy offers a robust
foundation for navigating various market conditions, it is essential
to acknowledge that no trading strategy is perfect,
and there are inherent trade-offs to consider. I believe it’s
important to address these limitations before introducing
the full strategy to ensure proper expectations and provide
a balanced perspective on what the A.M.P. can and cannot
	achieve.</p>
			<p><b>It is not “get rich quick:”</b></p>
<p>First and foremost, it is essential to recognize that the A.M.P.
is not a “get rich quick” scheme. If you are seeking to double
your account in a matter of months or chase the thrill of highrisk,
high-reward trades, then this strategy is not for you. The
A.M.P. is designed for traders who prioritize steady, reliable
returns over rapid account growth. It is a strategy for those
who understand that slow and steady wins the race, and that
	preserving capital is just as important as growing it.</p>
			<p><b>It does not outperform the market every year:</b></p>
<p>I believe a truly non-directional trading strategy offers a
more reliable pathway to trading for a living and performing
in all market types. However, performance in all market
types does not mean OUTPERFORMANCE in EVERY market
	type.</p>
<p>Since the A.M.P. is a hedged options selling strategy that
emphasizes protecting and growing capital across all market
conditions, it does not perform “as well” in bull markets
with low volatility. In some years, like 2017 and 2023, when
there is extremely low volatility combined with a “melt-up”
style bull run, it is difficult for hedge premium selling to keep
	up.</p>
<p>This is a deliberate trade-off – by prioritizing protection
against significant drawdowns, the A.M.P. may sacrifice
some potential upside during periods of sustained market
growth. It is crucial to have realistic expectations and understand that the strategy’s focus on capital preservation may
lead to underperformance on a “purely return basis” in some
	years.</p>
			<p><b>It is not “set and forget:”</b></p>
<p>Another important consideration is that while the A.M.P. requires
less frequent adjustments compared to many other
trading strategies, it is not entirely hands-off. Traders should
expect to make adjustments to their positions every 10 days
	or so, depending on market conditions.</p>
<p>This ongoing management is a necessary part of ensuring
that it remains responsive to changing market dynamics.
Traders who are looking for a completely passive investment
approach that requires no regular attention may find
	that the A.M.P. does not meet their needs.</p>
			<p><b>It is not the “end all be all:”</b></p>
<p>Once again, I am a non-directional trader. I don’t believe I
can predict the future and I personally believe having a truly
non-directional trading system offers a more reliable pathway
	to trading for a living and performing in all market types.</p>
<p>That said, traders with directional bias can outperform. That’s
why it’s essential to consider the diversification of your overall
investment and trading approaches. With that said, it is
entirely possible to trade All-Market Profit-type strategies
on top of a long bond or stock portfolio through a concept
called “Profit Stacking,” which we will cover in the next section
	of this book.</p>
			<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The All-Market Profit-type strategies are a robust, non-directional
trading methodology that prioritizes capital preservation
and steady returns across a wide range of market conditions.
However, like any strategy, it comes with its own set
	of limitations and trade-offs.</p>
<p>By understanding and embracing these characteristics –
from its focus on gradual account growth to its need for regular
management and its potential for underperformance in
certain market types – traders can make informed decisions
about whether the A.M.P. aligns with their individual goals
and risk tolerance.</p>
<p>As we move forward into Part 2 of this book, we will dive
deeper into the specifics of the <strong><em>All-Market Profits Trading
Framework</em></strong>, exploring the key components that make this
strategy so effective in navigating the complexities of options
trading. From the proactively hedged broken wing butterfly
structure to the advanced techniques of Profit Stacking, you
will gain the knowledge and tools necessary to implement
	this powerful approach in your own trading.</p>
<p>So, let’s turn the page and embark on this exciting journey
together as we unlock the secrets of the All-Market Profits
framework and discover how it can help you achieve performance
in all markets.</p>
