			<p class="center-text"><b>TRADER PITFALL Number 7: Complexity
Fails, Simple Scales</b></p>
			<p>The last pitfall that many traders make is overcomplicating
				their strategy.</p>
<p>Options trading offers incredible flexibility, which can be
both a blessing and a curse. With hundreds of strategies and
thousands of variations, such as straddles, strangles, condors,
iron condors, butterflies, and iron butterflies, it’s easy
	to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices.</p>
<p>Take one look under the hood at option-selling portfolios
from traders at tastytrade or YouTube. You might see dozens
of positions at one time, each with its own unique risk
profile, expiration dates, management criteria, and capital
	requirements.</p>
<p>Seeing other people trade so many strategies simultaneously
can tempt both novice and experienced traders to create
a complex web of overcomplicated, over-diversified, and difficult-
	to-manage strategies in their own portfolios.</p>
<p>The allure of changing up strategies or trying new approaches
based on someone else’s successful P&amp;L can be strong.
However, this temptation can lead to overwhelm and can be
counterproductive to the primary goal of trading: creating
time, not just money. Most traders don’t have the luxury of
sitting in front of their computers all day actively managing
their accounts. Doing so would turn trading into another fulltime
job, which defeats the purpose of passively growing
	wealth.</p>
<p>Moreover, juggling an overcomplicated portfolio of different
positions and strategies not only requires more screen time
but also makes you more prone to making suboptimal management
decisions, especially during market downturns. In
options trading, making money relies not only on having a
great strategy but also on effectively managing that strategy
	when the market becomes volatile.</p>
<p>If you don’t fully understand how to manage all your strategies,
it can be particularly problematic in a highly volatile
crash environment. During these times, effectively managing
and unwinding all of your positions can be extremely difficult
and stressful, potentially leading to massive losses. I
learned this expensive lesson the hard way during the flash
crash of 2018 when I had to leg in and out of positions, wiping
	out months of gains.</p>
<p><b>My advice is simple: master simplicity before earning the
	right to complexity.</b></p>
<p>Avoid chasing “shiny objects” until you have mastered one
or two core strategies. Go a mile deep with your strategy
rather than a mile wide across dozens of “half-baked” strategies.
Remember, the real money in options trading comes
from how you manage your strategies. Don’t become a jack
	of all trades and a master of none.</p>
<p>Focus on developing a deep understanding of a simple, yet
effective strategy that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
By doing so, you’ll be better equipped to navigate
market volatility and make sound management decisions
when the time comes. As you gain experience and confidence,
you can gradually expand your repertoire, but always
prioritize mastery over complexity.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Complexity &amp; Time Management Self-Assessment Exercise</b></p>
			<p>Before we proceed with the rest of this book, let’s assess
your current trading approach in terms of complexity and
				time management.</p>
<p>Answer the following questions honestly to determine if
your trading strategy aligns with your goals and lifestyle.
Rate each statement on a scale from 1 to 5 using the provided
	scale for each question.</p>
<p>Once you’ve rated yourself for each statement, total up your
scores and use the Answer Key to determine your next steps.</p>
			<table>
			<th>Success Check-in Statement</th><th>Self Rating</th>
			<tr>
				<td>I have a clear understanding of the risk
profile and management requirements
for each strategy I employ. (1 = Strongly
Agree, 5 = Strongly Disagree)</td><td></td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>I spend a significant portion of my day
monitoring and adjusting my trades. (1 =
Never, 5 = Very Frequently)</td><td></td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>I often find myself overwhelmed by the
number of positions and strategies I'm
managing simultaneously. (1 = Never, 5 =
Very Frequently)</td><td></td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>I believe that using more complex strategies
is the key to better trading results. (1
= Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree)</td><td></td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>My trading approach allows me to maintain
a healthy work-life balance. (1 =
Strongly Agree, 5 = Strongly Disagree)</td><td></td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>TOTAL UP YOUR SCORE:</b></td><td></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p class="center-text"><b>What Your Score Really Means</b></p>
			<p class="center-text">Score: 21 to 25 points</p>
			<p>Your trading approach seems to be highly complex and
time-consuming. While this may suit some experienced traders,
it’s essential to ensure that your trading aligns with your
overall goals and lifestyle. Consider streamlining your approach
to reduce stress and improve your trading efficiency.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Score: 13 to 19 points</p>
			<p>Your trading strategy appears to have a moderate level of
complexity and may require significant time commitment.
It’s important to assess whether this aligns with your trading
goals and personal preferences. If you find yourself struggling
to balance trading with other aspects of your life, consider
exploring ways to optimize your approach.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Score: 5 to 12 points</p>
			<p>Your trading approach seems to be relatively simple and
manageable, which can be a good foundation for long-term
success. However, it’s still important to ensure that your
				strategy is effective and aligned with your goals.</p>
<p>Regardless of your score, remember that the key to successful
trading is finding a strategy that works for you and aligns
with your goals, risk tolerance, and lifestyle. The following
chapters will provide valuable insights and tools to help you</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Key Chapter Takeaways</b></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Costly Pitfall Number 1: Choosing the Wrong Information
Source </strong>
			  <p>Understand the criticality of using credible and unbiased
			    sources for trading information. Avoid reliance on
			    media personalities and online trading gurus who may
			    not provide profitable advice. Think, “If their P&amp;L is not
			    real, what else are they trying to conceal?”</p>
			</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall Number 2: Believing Market Success Comes
from Predicting </strong>
  <p>Acknowledge the difficulty and unreliability of predicting
    stock movements. Focus on strategies that aren’t
    heavily reliant on market direction predictions, ones
    with a proven edge.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall Number 3: Choosing Low Probability Strategies </strong>
  <p>Emphasize the importance of selecting trading strategies
    based on their likelihood of success and alignment
    with investment goals. Be cautious of popular but
    low-probability trading methods. Instead, seek methods
    with probabilistic edges such as selling options.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall Number 4: Believing High-Win Rates = Success </strong>
  <p>Recognize that high-win rates do not guarantee overall
    trading success. Prioritize strategies that offer sustainable
    and risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, realize that
    drawdowns are the #1 impediment to long-term success.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall Number 5: Not Being Truly Diversified </strong>
  <p>Understand the limitations of traditional diversification
    methods, especially during systemic market downturns.
    Seek true diversification that can withstand market
    crashes by being long in the only asset that rises in a
    crash - volatility.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall Number 6: Remove Emotions &amp; Subjectivity </strong>
  <p>Stress the importance of removing emotional biases
    from trading decisions. Utilize a systematic, rule-based
    approach to ensure consistency in trading.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Costly Pitfall Number 7: Simple Scales, Complexity Fails </strong>
  <p>Avoid chasing “shiny toy objects” until you master one
    or two core strategies. Go a mile deep with your strategy
    rather than a mile wide across dozens of “half-baked”
    strategies and remember that the real money with options
    trading is by how you manage your strategies!</p>
