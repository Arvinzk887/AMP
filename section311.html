		<p class="center-text"><b>TRADER PITFALL #4: BELIEVING HIGH-WIN RATES &amp; RETURNS = SUCCESS</b></p>
		<p>Many traders (myself included) initially turn to selling options
due to the high win rates and statistical edge the approach
offers. High probability strategies, such as the traditional
wheel options strategy, selling credit spreads, or anything
recommended on tastytrade, might make you feel unstoppable,
			invincible, and overconfident, but there’s a trap.</p>
<p>High win rates might seem attractive, but they don’t necessarily
equal success. Theta decay is not necessarily your
	savior if one or two bad trades can wipe out your account.</p>
<p>I call this the 95 percent Win-Rate Trap.</p>
		<p>You may have even been here before. You’re trading along,
winning trade after trade, collecting your weekly paychecks
and making a killing at 30 percent to 60 percent plus a year, thinking, “I cracked
the code.” Then, you continue to get more and more confident
and continue to leverage up without truly understanding
		the risk. But, what happens?</p>
<p>It’s what typically happens to many of the “high-win rate”
touting gurus. They proudly proclaim their 95 percent win rate
but conveniently omit the impact of market crashes. Market
crashes can and will wreak havoc on high-win rate portfolios,
	leading to significant drawdowns or unrecoverable losses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these gurus seldom address or even acknowledge
this critical aspect. Again a high win rate is a vanity
metric. This is why many traders liken selling premiums
to picking up pennies in front of a steamroller because one
bad trade can wipe out months or years of profit. They are
	often betting the empire for a pot of gold.</p>
		<p>The biggest impediment to building stock market wealth.</p>
<p>Similarly to prioritizing high-win rates, many traders also
	tend to prioritize high returns over high-risk-adjusted returns.
Outperforming isn’t just about achieving a higher percentage
of returns, it’s also about considering the amount of
risk you are taking. The real enemy of a trading system and
	profits is drawdowns.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett is famously quoted as saying: “The first rule
of an investment is don’t lose [money]. And the second rule
	of an investment is don’t forget the first rule.”</p>
<p>No seasoned investor or trader will ever argue with that logic.
However, it is worth including in this book because I don’t
think most traders and investors fully understand why drawdowns
are the biggest impediment to building stock market
	wealth.</p>
<p>As you probably know, a drawdown refers to the reduction
in the value of your investment account from its peak. It occurs
when your account value decreases, often due to market
losses or unfavorable trading decisions. Your portfolio is
	either making all-time highs or recovering from drawdowns.</p>
<p>Understanding drawdowns is vital because they directly affect
your portfolio’s performance and ability to recover from
	losses.</p>
		<p><b>Consider this example:</b></p>
		<table>
		  <tr>
			  <th>Drawdown Percentage&nbsp; in Trading Capital</th><th>Return Percentage to Get Back to Even</th>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			  <td>Negative 5 Percent</td><td>5.3 Percent</td>
		  </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 10 Percent</td><td>11.1 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 15 Percent</td><td>17.6 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 20 Percent</td><td>25.0 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 25 Percent</td><td>33.3 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 30 Percent</td><td>42.9 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 35 Percent</td><td>53.8 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 40 Percent</td><td>66.7 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 45 Percent</td><td>81.8 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 50 Percent</td><td>100.0 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 55 Percent</td><td>122.2 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 60 Percent</td><td>150.0 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 65 Percent</td><td>185.7 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 70 Percent</td><td>233.3 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 75 Percent</td><td>300.0 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 80 Percent</td><td>400.0 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 85 Percent</td><td>566.7 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 90 Percent</td><td>900.0 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>Negative 95 Percent</td><td>1900.0 Percent</td>
		    </tr>
	    </table>
		<ul>
			<li>If you experience a 10 Percent drawdown, you need an 11 Percent
			return to break even.</li>
			<li>With a 30 Percent drawdown, you require a 43 Percent return to recover.</li>
			<li>A 50 Percent drawdown means you need a 100 Percent return to getback to your starting point.</li>
	    </ul>
		<p>To put this in perspective, if a Hundred Thousad Dollar portfolio suffers a
50 Percent drawdown, it drops to Fifty Thousad Dollars. To return to hundred thousand dollars ,
a 100 Percent return is needed - meaning you would have to double
		your account just to get back to breakeven.</p>
<p>For this reason, it’s important to mitigate drawdowns as
much as possible, as larger drawdowns require disproportionately
larger returns to recover - it becomes an up hill battle
	to regain your portfolio’s initial value.</p>
		<p><b>The True Cost of Drawdowns:</b></p>
<p>Managing a portfolio effectively means keeping drawdowns
to a minimum not only for the financial implications but also
for your emotional well-being. Severe drawdowns can lead
to irrational decision-making, overtrading, sleepless nights,
and heightened stress and anxiety. Heck! When I last blew
up my account in 2008, this “drawdown” plagued me with 5
	years of asthma.</p>
