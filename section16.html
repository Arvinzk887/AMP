			<h2>Chapter 9: Choosing the Best Broker for
All-Market Profits</h2>
			<p>Now that you’ve learned the steps for effectively validating
and refining your trading ideas through backtesting, it’s time
to take the next crucial step in your trading journey: choosing
				the right broker.</p>
<p>Even if you have a broker that you are currently satisfied
with, it is important to ensure that your broker fits with your
trading needs. Your choice of broker can significantly impact
your trading experience, from the tools and resources available
	to you to the commissions and fees you’ll pay.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll guide you through the process of choosing
the best broker for your individual trading requirements.
We’ll discuss the key factors to consider, such as platform
features, commissions and fees, margin requirements, and
customer support. By the end of this chapter, I aim to equip
you with the knowledge needed so you can select a broker
	that aligns with your trading goals and style.</p>
			<p><strong>Understanding Your Trading Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Before diving into the comparison of different brokerages,
it’s essential to take a step back and assess your own trading
requirements. As an options trader, you’ll need a brokerage
that offers a robust platform with the necessary tools
	and features to support your trading style.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the following factors as prerequisites when
evaluating your trading needs:</strong></p>
			<ol>
			<li><p><strong>Options trading level:</strong> Trading levels, also known as approval
levels, protect both the broker and the customer.
Options brokers are regulated and have a duty to look
out for the best interests of their customers, which gives
them an obligation to ensure that their customers only
take risks for which they have sufficient experience and
				funds.</p>
				<p>Most options brokers assign trading levels from 1 to 5
with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. A trader
with a low trading level will be fairly limited in the
strategies they can use, while one with the highest will
be able to make pretty much whatever trade they want.
Ensure that the brokerage you choose supports the level
of options trading you intend to pursue, whether it’s
					basic, intermediate, or advanced.</p></li>
				<li><strong>Platform features:</strong> Look for a brokerage that provides a
user-friendly platform with advanced charting, risk management
					tools, and real-time data.</li>
<li><strong>Commissions and fees:</strong> Compare the commission
	structures and fees across different brokerages to ensure you’re getting a competitive rate.</li>
<li><strong>Margin requirements:</strong> If you plan to use margin or trade
more advanced strategies, ensure that the brokerage
offers the appropriate margin requirements and account
types (e.g., Portfolio Margin, SPAN Margin).</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Comparing Top Brokerages for Options Trading</strong></p>
			<p>To help you make an informed decison, let's compare seven of the top online brokerages across various criteria.</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Think or swim</li>
			<li>Interactive Brokers</li>
			<li>tasty trade</li>
			<li>E Trade</li>
			<li>Fidelity</li>
			<li>Tradier</li>
			<li>Trade Station</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="center-text"><strong>Zero-Commission Brokers: The Hidden Costs</strong></p>
			<p>I believe it’s important to quickly highlight why I
didn’t include any zero-commission brokers that
have been gaining popularity in recent years such
as Robinhood and Webull have gained popularity
among retail traders. Though these platforms offer
commission-free trades it’s essential to understand
				the potential hidden costs of these brokers.</p>
<p>The old adage “if the service is free, you’re the
product” holds true in the case of zero-commission
brokers. These platforms often generate revenue
by selling their users’ order flow to market makers
and high-frequency trading firms. This practice,
known as payment for order flow (PFOF), allows
these firms to gain valuable insights into retail traders’
behavior and potentially exploit this information
	for their own benefit.</p>
<p>When a broker sells your order flow, it means that
your trades may not be executed at the best available
price, as the market makers and high-frequency
traders can manipulate the bid-ask spread to
their advantage. This can result in hidden costs for
traders, as they may end up paying more for their
trades than they would with a traditional, commission-
	based broker.</p>
<p>Moreover, the practice of selling order flow can
create conflicts of interest, as the broker’s incentives
may not align with their clients’ best interests.
This lack of transparency and potential for suboptimal
trade execution should be a red flag for traders
	seeking a reliable, trustworthy brokerage partner.</p>
<p>Let’s now run through FIVE important criteria to help guide
your process of choosing a suitable broker for your trading
needs:</p>
			<p class="center-text">Criteria Number 1: Availability and Account Requirements</p>
			<p>When choosing a brokerage, it’s crucial to ensure that it’s
available in your country and that you meet the account requirements.
While most brokerages on our list are available
in the United States, some, like Interactive Brokers and tastytrade,
have a more extensive global presence. Additionally,
some brokerages may have higher minimum account
balance requirements for certain features, such as Portfolio
Margin.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Criteria Number 2: Options Trading Platforms and Tools</p>
			<p>A powerful and user-friendly trading platform is essential for
options traders. Think or swim, Interactive Brokers, and tasty works
stand out for their robust platforms, offering advanced
charting, risk management tools, and customizable layouts.
E TRADE and Fidelity also provide solid platforms, although
they may not be as feature-rich as the top contenders.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Criteria Number 3: Commissions and Fees</p>
			<p>While most brokerages now offer competitive commission
rates, it’s still essential to compare the fees across different
brokerages. Tradier, for example, offers a flat-fee pricing
structure that may be attractive to high-volume traders.
However, keep in mind that the lowest commissions may not
always be the best choice if the brokerage lacks the features
and tools you need.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Criteria Number 4:Margin Requirements and Advanced
Features</p>
			<p>For traders looking to employ more advanced strategies
or trade with higher leverage, Portfolio Margin and SPAN
Margin are crucial features to consider. Think or swim, Interactive
Brokers, and tasty works offer both Portfolio Margin
and SPAN Margin, making them suitable for advanced traders.
E TRADE and Fidelity provide Portfolio Margin but lack
SPAN Margin, while Tradier and TradeStation have more limited
offerings in this area.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Criteria Number 5: Customer Support and Education</p>
			<p>As you embark on your options trading journey, having access
to reliable customer support and educational resources
can be invaluable. Consider the level of support each
brokerage offers, such as live chat, phone assistance, and
email support. Additionally, look for brokerages that provide
a wide range of educational materials, including webinars,
tutorials, and in-depth guides, to help you continually improve
your trading skills.</p>
			<p class="center-text">My Preferred Options Broker</p>
			<p>Determining which broker to use is ultimately a
personal choice that can vary based on your preference
and location; however, I typically recommend
either Thinkorswim or Interactive Brokers for
the following reasons:</p>
			<ol>
			<li><p>The ability to execute ‘unconventional’ custom
orders on a single ticket.</p>
				<p>When you have a truly unique trade, some
brokers treat your account differently. Some of
the trade structures I utilize require a custom
order that is so unique that some brokers do
not permit it to be executed on a single ticket -
resulting in them requiring you to “leg in” and
“leg out” of a position. <strong>This is not the case
with Think or swim and Interactive Brokers</strong></p></li>
			<li><p>Advanced trade grouping and management</p>
				<p>When leveraging a “campaign-style” trading
approach that enables you to diversify the
portfolio across both time and volatility, specific
requirements need to be satisfied, such
as the ability to add trade chain history into a
risk graph.</p></li>
			<li><p>SPAN and Portfolio Margin + the ability to trade
options on either SPX or /ES.</p>
				<p>My strategies never employ naked option selling.
However, I still recommend that my students
get the highest options trading approval
from your broker. Both Thinkorswim and Interactive
Brokers allow trading options on futures
and give traders the ability to employ SPAN
and/or Portfolio Margin.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>DYOR: Do Your Own Research</p>
<p>While this chapter has provided a detailed overview of the
factors to consider when choosing a broker, it’s essential to
conduct your own research to ensure you find the best fit for
your specific needs. There are many valuable “broker comparison”
sites online that offer detailed reviews and rankings
	of online brokers based on various criteria.</p>
<p>In addition to using comparison websites, be sure to visit
the official websites of the brokers you’re considering. Take
the time to explore their platforms, read through their pricing
and fee structures, and review their educational resources
and customer support offerings. Many brokers offer demo
accounts, which allow you to test their platforms and tools
without risking real money. Take advantage of these opportunities
	to get a firsthand feel for each broker’s offerings.</p>
<p>Finally, keep an eye out for sign-up bonuses or promotions
offered by brokers. Some brokers may offer incentives such
as free trades, cash bonuses, or educational resources to
new account holders. While these bonuses shouldn’t be the
sole deciding factor in your choice of broker, they can provide
additional value and support as you begin your options
	trading journey.</p>
			<p>Putting It All Together</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best brokerage for you will depend on your
individual trading needs and preferences. By carefully evaluating
your requirements and comparing the features and
offerings of different brokerages, you can make an informed
decision that sets you up for success in your options trading
	journey.</p>
<p>As you progress in your trading journey, you may find that
your needs evolve, and you may need to reassess your brokerage
choice. Don’t be afraid to make a change if you outgrow
your current brokerage or find that it no longer meets
your needs.</p>
