			<h2>Chapter 4: The Key to Truly Non-Directional, All-Market Trading Profits (and Why Many Fall Short)</h2>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we explored seven costly pitfalls
that hinder successful trading and investing. However, one
of the most significant obstacles to long-term options trading
success is not utilizing an options structure that consistently
generates profits in ALL market conditions: bull, bear,
				sideways, and crashes.</p>
<p>To thrive in any market environment, I believe the first step
is to adopt a versatile, comprehensive option structure that
accomplishes several things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It capitalizes on Theta decay.</li>
				<li>It effectively eliminates directional risk</li>
				<li>It is proactively hedged against volatility risk.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The issue lies in the fact that most “traditional” options structures,
such as iron condors, spreads, and butterflies, often
carry hidden directional risk, rendering them ineffective in
			harnessing the edge provided by selling options.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I will unveil components of one of my preferred
options structures that I believe is the key to achieving
truly non-directional trading profits. This structure is
the cornerstone for the full “All-Market Proftis” framework
	that you’ll learn in Part 2 of this book.</p>
<p>With that said, before delving into the specifics of one of
my preferred option structures, I believe it’s crucial to take a
step back and clarify the “common” definition of non-directional
trading as understood by most options traders. From
there, I will explain why I believe many traditional “non-directional”
	structures are deceivingly directional.</p>
<p>Next, I will highlight the advantages a broken wing butterfly
(BWB) options structure offers as a foundation for non-directional
profits, while also addressing its limitations. Finally, I’ll
present why adding a proactive hedge to the BWB is crucial
for achieving true non-directionality.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Author Note:</b></p>
			<p>It’s important to note that while I’ll be focusing on
one of my preferred option structures in this chapter,
there are other structures that can be used to
				achieve non-directional trading.</p>
<p>However, I cannot overstate the importance of having
a well-designed options structure as the foundation of your trading strategy. It is the 80/20 rule
in action - without a solid, non-directional options
structure, the other components of the All-Market
Profits framework, such as trade management, will
	not be as effective.</p>
<p>The options structure is the bedrock upon which
the entire strategy is built, and its significance
should not be underestimated. I will be giving you
the theory in this chapter and I will detail the exact
	construction of the structure in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>FINAL NOTE: If any of the topics covered in this
chapter feel over your head, I encourage you to go
through my Full Throttle Options Program so you
can get up to speed on the foundational options
concepts I reference in this chapter and throughout
this book: <em>www.real-pl.com/full-throttle-options</em></p>
			<p>What is the “common” definition of non-directional
				trading?</p>
<p>As we know, directional trading strategies are a common
	reason most people fail to profit consistently in the market.</p>
			<p><b>Why?</b> Directional trading involves making directional bets
on the future price movements of a stock and predicting this
direction is difficult at best and impossible at worst.</p>
<p>So we turn to selling options because they offer the potential
to make money without the need to accurately predict
the future direction of the stock. Options are depreciating
	assets, and their value tends to decay over time (Theta decay).</p>
<p><b>One key to successful options trading is capturing this depreciation
	while avoiding directional risk.</b> In other words,
we want to harness the Premium Seller’s Edge without
movements in the underlying overpowering that edge. This
is commonly referred to as removing directional risk or Delta
	risk.</p>
<p>Directional (Delta) risk is significant because, for sellers of
options, the value of the option they sold (and potentially
need to buy back or settle) can increase significantly if the
	underlying asset moves in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Avoiding directional risk is where the term “non-directional”
comes from. In a broad sense, non-directional trading
strategies “attempt” to generate consistent returns without
needing to predict the market’s direction accurately (though
	most are still directional to some degree).</p>
			<p>Does Non-Directional Mean Delta-Neutral?</p>
<p>If you’re a seasoned options enthusiast, you might have
heard of non-directional trading referred to as Delta-neutral
	trading.</p>
<p>Common Delta-neutral strategies like strangles, iron condors,
and butterflies involve balancing the Delta of each leg
to equal zero, making them appear non-directional at first
	glance.</p>
<p>In theory, these “Delta-neutral” strategies might seem non-directional because the underlying asset can move slightly up,
down, or remain sideways, and the trade can still hit its profit
	target.</p>
<p>However, in practice, I argue that these strategies are deceivingly
directional because they still rely on prediction to
	some degree.</p>
			<p><b>Take the Iron Condor for example:</b></p>
			<p>In this case, the trader is betting that the stock will remain
sideways, go slightly up, or go slightly down. The strategy’s
success depends on the underlying asset’s price staying
within a specific range. Significant moves outside that range
				will lead to losses, undermining the non-directional intent.</p>
<p>Moreover, traditional Delta-neutral structures are only Delta-
neutral for a single moment in time. If the underlying
moves slightly against you, the structure is no longer Delta-
neutral, revealing that many of these structures are often
just predictional bets on the underlying remaining in a tight
	range, making them deceivingly directional.</p>
<p>True non-directionality requires more than just balancing
Deltas. It means having a structure that profits in all four key
options selling market regimes, not just one or two. It also
means accounting for higher-order Greeks, like Gamma and
	Vomma (covered in Chapter 6), not just Delta.</p>
<p><b>So, what is a robust yet flexible starting structure that can
form the foundation for truly non-directional trading?
I believe a good starting point is a Long Put Broken Wing
	Butterfly (BWB).</b></p>
<p>The Broken Wing Butterfly: Why I Prefer It as the
	Foundational Structure for All-Market Profits?</p>
<p>A Long Put Broken Wing Butterfly (BWB) is an effective starting
structure for truly non-directional trading, consisting of
	all out-of-the-money (OTM) puts.</p>
<p>This structure involves:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Long one OTM put at a higher strike - less OTM than the
				middle.</li>
			<li>Short two OTM puts at the middle strike.</li>
			<li>Long one OTM put at a lower strike - more OTM than the middle.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This asymmetric arrangement of strikes forms the broken
				wing of the butterfly spread.</p>
<p><strong>There are several advantages to this structure as a starting
point.</strong></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Advantage Number 1: Positive Theta &amp; Headroom</b></p>
			<p>The structure is positive Theta meaning that it benefits from
the passage of time (time decay). Positive Theta can show
up if you look at a long put broken wing butterfly structure
				on a risk graph through what I call “positive headroom.”</p>
<p>Positive headroom is easily understood by examining a risk
graph. It shows how the profit and loss (P&amp;L) is expected to
trend upwards, moving into positive territory, assuming all
other factors remain constant. Simply put, if the market conditions
	stay the same, the P&amp;L will likely increase.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the current position (marked by the blue dot)
has positive headroom. Given that the T+0 Line is lower than
the next T+X Lines, the position is expected to increase in
value over time (all else being equal). This is positive headroom.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Advantage Number 2: Potentially Zero Upside Risk</b></p>
			<p>A Long put Broken Wing Butterfly (BWB) can be set up to
define the upside risk. In a scenario where the stock price
increases significantly, the maximum risk is defined. If the
position is set up with a net credit, the trader may keep the
credit as profit if all options expire worthless. If it’s set up
with a net debit, this debit represents the maximum loss. The
upside risk can also be mitigated further through effective
management.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Advantge Number 3: Delta Neutrality &amp; Flat Gamma Lines</p>
			<p>At trade entry, the BWB can be Delta-neutral with flat Gamma.
This means it is not only non-directional but has a stable
Delta that is less sensitive to price movement than other
				spreads.</p>
<p>We will discuss the importance of flat Gamma in future chapters.
That said, when looking at a long-put BWB on a risk
graph, the slope of the T+0 Line is flat. Having flat T+0 Lines
is indicative of both Delta neutrality and Gamma neutrality.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Advantage Number 4: Long Runway plus Margin of Safety</p>
			<p>Runway refers to the extent of price fluctuation an underlying
asset can undergo before substantially affecting the position’s
profit and loss (P&amp;L). A position with a longer runway
can tolerate greater price changes before there’s a notable
impact on the P&amp;L, while a shorter runway indicates less tolerance
to price shifts. A flatter Gamma curve indicates a longer
runway.</p>
			<p>In this example of a butterfly position, the current position
(indicated by the red dot) is further away from the tent (upper
long strike). This presents a longer runway - the margin
of safety before direction overcomes the Premium Seller’s
Edge.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Advantage Number 5: Exploitation of Higher-Order Greeks</b></p>
			<p>As you’ll discover in Part 2, second-order Greeks, like Gamma,
Charm, Vomma, and Vanna, are the key to being truly
non-directional. Only managing first-order Greeks, like Delta,
Theta, and Vega, is not enough to mine the Premium Seller’s
Edge. A structure like the BWB can help you control and
				exploit the second-order Greeks to your advantage.</p>
			<p><b>The Traditional Broken Wing Butterfly IS INCOMPLETE</b></p>
<p>While the long put broken wing butterfly offers distinct advantages
that can set the foundation for truly non-directional
	success, I believe it is incomplete for one critical reason.</p>
<p>Because a traditional put broken wing butterfly is short volatility,
crash environments and black swan events can significantly
impact the profitability of this structure due to the
	significant tail risk.</p>
<p>That is why I believe it’s crucial to modify this structure to
mitigate volatility and Vega risk by being LONG volatility
	through a built-in proactive hedge.</p>
<p>Black Swan &amp; Crash Environments: The Need for a
	Proactive “Built-In” Hedge</p>
<p>While the long put broken wing butterfly offers distinct advantages
that can set the foundation for truly non-directional
success, it’s crucial to recognize its limitations. As a
standalone strategy, a traditional put broken wing butterfly
is inherently short volatility, leaving it vulnerable to significant
drawdowns during crash environments and black swan
	events.</p>
<p>To effectively navigate these turbulent market conditions,
it’s essential to incorporate a proactive hedge that mitigates
volatility risk by maintaining long volatility exposure. The primary
purpose of this hedge is to protect capital during market
downturns, particularly when “crash correlation” comes
	into play, and asset prices across the board are plummeting.</p>
<p>The key lies in being proactively long volatility before a crash
occurs. Attempting to hedge reactively once a market decline
is underway is often too late, as the cost of protective
puts skyrockets and liquidity evaporates. Moreover, trying
to time the bottom or predict the extent of the selloff with
reactive hedges can lead to whipsawing, further stress, and
	additional losses.</p>
<p>To preserve capital and sleep well at night, the optimal approach
is to be proactively hedged and already own the
one asset that everyone wants in a crash – long volatility
exposure. However, it’s equally important to ensure that the
options portfolio is still profitable during non-crash market
	scenarios.</p>
<p>Therein lies the challenge: the cost of maintaining the long
volatility hedge that will save your account during a crash
needs to be offset by profits generated during normal market
	conditions.</p>
<p>Striking this delicate balance requires a meticulously designed
options trade structure that capitalizes on Theta decay
and mitigates volatility risk simultaneously. The structure
must be able to weather the storm during crashes while still
	generating profits in calmer markets.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to bring it all together and reveal the cornerstone
structure that I believe is the key to achieving consistent
profits in any market condition: the proactively hedged
broken wing butterfly - or what I like to call the <b>All-Market
	Profits 1-2-2 option structure (the A.M.P. 1-2-2).</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>The Cornerstone "All-Market Proftits" Trading Structure</b></p>
			<p>The basic building blocks of the All-Market Profits 1-2-2 are
the same as those of the long put broken wing butterfly.
However, instead of only one long put at the lower strike, we
now have TWO long puts at the lower strike. This means that
				there are now 3 long puts and 2 short puts.</p>
<p>I will reveal the exact criteria (including Delta, DTEs, etc.) for
the structure in Chapter 7 of this book. However, on a surface
level, when this structure is constructed correctly, it has
all of the advantages of the Long Put Broken Wing Butterfly
previously covered, along with several other crucial components
for all market profits - primarily the built-in hedge.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Additional Advantage Number 1: Long Volatility - More Long Puts Than Short Puts</p>
			<p>One of the keys for a truly non-directional option structure
is to have more long puts than short puts. How this is expressed
in the All-Market Profits 1-2-2 structure is to have
two long puts on the lower leg. Again, I’ll reveal the exact
				details in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>With more long puts than short puts, the structure maintains
a long volatility exposure, which is essential for profiting
during crash environments when volatility spikes. The exact
dynamics of this phenomenon have to do with the higher-order
Greek, Vomma (which will be explained thoroughly in
Chapter 6).</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Additional Advantage Number 2: The Hedge is "Built-in"</b></p>
			<p>The protective hedge is seamlessly integrated into the
structure, eliminating the need to manage separate hedging
positions. This streamlines trade management and reduces
the complexity of the overall portfolio.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Additional Advantage Number 3: Designed to Hang Out in Profit Hump</b></p>
			<p>The proactively hedged broken wing butterfly (A.M.P. 1-2-
2) is designed to maximize time spent in the “Profit Hump”
area of the risk graph. “Profit Humps” are points on a risk
graph where the T plus X Lines experience changes in slope, resulting
in a price area where the position is in its maximum
potential profitability. By carefully selecting strike prices and
expiration dates, it is possible to optimize the structure to
				capitalize on this key region.</p>
<p><b>Advantages of the All-Market Profits 1-2-2 Trade Structure
	[RECAP]</b></p>
<p>By combining the benefits of positive Theta, flat Delta and
Gamma, and long volatility exposure, the All-Market Profits
1-2-2 structure emerges as a cornerstone structure for traders
	seeking consistent profits in all market conditions.</p>
<p>It’s important that while this structure serves as a robust
starting point for building a non-directional options trading
strategy, it is just that - a starting point. The structure must be
adapted to account for varying market conditions, volatility
levels, and the specific goals of the individual trader.</p>
			<p><b>Chapter Summary</b></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’ve explored the essential components
of a truly non-directional trading strategy, culminating in the
revelation of the All-Market Profits 1-2-2 structure as a suitable
				options trading structure for all-market profitability.</p>
<p>By combining the benefits of positive Theta, flat Delta and
Gamma, and long volatility exposure, this structure can be
managed to unlock consistent profits in any market condition.
It addresses the limitations of traditional “Delta-neutral”
strategies and provides a robust starting point for traders
	seeking to navigate the challenges of all market environments.</p>
<p>Remember, the All-Market Profits 1-2-2 is just the beginning.
In the following chapters, we’ll dive deeper into how to adapt
and optimize this structure for various market conditions,
creating a comprehensive trading plan that can weather any
storm.</p>
