            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>What if you could make money in the stock market without needing a “crystal ball” or fancy “magic wand” indicator?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, what if you could remove any discretion, emotions, or subjectivity from your trading?</p>
			<p>Do you suppose your trading will become a bit more enjoyable, consistent, and profitable?</p>
			<p><b>That is the goal of this book:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>To show that success in the stock market does not need to come from ‘timing the market’ or predicting whether a stock’s price will rise or fall.</li>
                <li>To help you remove emotions from your decision-making and throw all your “trading psychology” books in the trash.</li>
                <li>Finally, it is possible to profit in all market types - bull, bear, sideways, and crashes - when you have a well-designed options investing approach that removes both “directional bets” and “discretionary tactics” from the equation.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>I call this truly non-directional and mechanical approach the “All-Market Profits” Trading Framework (A.M.P. for short).</p>
          <p>By the time you finish this book, I aim to give the principles and framework for implementing and tailoring your own All-Market Profits strategy in your own trading, paving the way for you to work with me and my team directly if you seek expert guidance.</p>
          <p><strong>To that end, I have structured this book as follows:</strong></p>
          <p>First, we will explore the pitfalls and shortcomings that have likely hindered your trading success thus far. Through frank self-assessments, I will provide you with an honest evaluation of your current approach based on my decades of experience in navigating the markets.</p>
          <p>Next, I will make a case for adopting a truly non-directional, volatility-harnessing strategy that removes the need for prediction and market timing. You will soon understand why such an approach is the answer to the struggles faced by many traders.</p>
          <p>We will then dive deep into the core principles and components of the “All-Market Profits” trading methodology. My students and I use this approach to achieve consistent profits across bull, bear, sideways, and even crash environments.</p>
          <p>From there, you will learn how to construct, optimize, and manage one of my favorite option trading structures. This unique, unconventional, proprietary structure is a foundation for truly non-directional trading. I will share insights into harnessing higher-order Greeks, executing trades, managing positions, and backtesting strategies for long-term success.</p>
          <p>The goal is for you to emerge from this book armed with a comprehensive understanding of how to build and implement your own “All-Market Profits” system, tailored to your 6 individual needs and risk tolerance.</p>
          <p>It might sound like a lot, but really, the entirety of this book can be summed up in the following three points:</p>
<p><strong>Point #1:</strong> Consistent trading success does not rely on predicting market movements but rather on controlling risk through truly non-directional, volatility-hedged strategies.</p>
          <p><strong>Point #2:</strong> By harnessing proven statistical edges and higher-order option Greeks, it is possible to generate profits across all market conditions without falling prey to emotional decision-making.</p>
          <p><strong>Point #3:</strong> The “All-Market Profits” approach outlined in this book provides a robust, data-driven framework for achieving this goal, backed by decades of experience and continuous refinement.</p>
          <p>No more falling victim to “fake gurus” promising unrealistic riches. No more struggling with strategies that falter in certain market conditions. The approach you are about to discover has been instrumental in transforming my own trading journey, allowing me and the traders I’ve mentored to navigate market complexities with consistency, peace of mind, and outperformance. I hope that through this book, you will be able to forge a similar path to lasting trading success.</p>
          <p>More than just a trading guide, this book is a blueprint for designing a trading business that aligns with your values, 7 goals, and lifestyle aspirations - to help you get one step closer to claiming your financial destiny.</p>
          <p>If, after reading this book, you find yourself eager to implement the “All-Market Profits” trading approach under expert guidance, I invite you to book a call with me or my team by visiting:</p>

          <p>Every trader is unique. We are here to support you and tailor the principles you’ll learn in this book based on your unique goals, experience, and risk tolerances. Helping traders like yourself achieve consistent, risk-managed profits through non-directional strategies is the core mission of my work.</p>

          <h2>Chapter 1: Becoming an All Market Trader</h2>
            <p>Don’t be like me.</p>
            <p>At the time of this writing, I am 56 years old. I’ve been obsessed with passive income ever since I was 19. My goal has always been the same: make as much money with as little “work” as possible.</p>
            <p>In other words, I wanted to retire early and do what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it and not have money get in the way - I am sure most of you share that common goal.</p>
          <p>On my quest for “financial independence,” I’ve fixed and flipped real estate, owned rental properties, purchased a laundromat, invested in franchises, and gotten involved with many other passive income “business opportunities” not worth mentioning.</p>
          <p>But, they all had one drawback – the financial investment was large but so was the investment of time…something I 13 really didn’t have back then as a father of four (a son and triplet daughters).</p>
          <p>That's when I turned to online trading.</p>
          <p>The allure of “working” from anywhere without any employees or overhead sucked me right in. I could escape the rat race, provide for my family, and live a lifestyle with financial security while my capital grew as I slept.</p>
          <p>On this quest to trade for a living, I tried fundamental analysis and stock picking, but that didn’t meet my goals.</p>
          <p>I tried technical analysis, but the ambiguity left more to be desired. I had a brief stint in buying options, but the low probabilities crushed my account.</p>
          <p>That’s when I finally “thought” I had found my edge in selling options. I could use an arsenal of “traditional” options selling structures such as spreads, calendars, iron condors, and butterflies and make money regardless of whether the market went up, down, or sideways.</p>
          <p>With time decay and the high probabilities on my side, my initial jaunt into premium selling had me feeling on top of the world.</p>
          <p>I won 95%+ of my trades, collected my weekly paychecks, and felt invincible. With this newfound sense of confidence, I decided to liquidate all my other assets (I had a few rental properties at the time) and put all my capital into my trading account with the dream of quitting my corporate job and trading for a living.</p>
          <p><strong>That dream was taken away from me one day:</strong> September 30th, 2008.</p>
          <p>The fateful Monday was one of the early days of the “Great Recession.” President Bush was supposed to sign off on the TARP relief program. When he failed to do that, the market went into a tailspin. The VIX volatility index spiked to almost 70, <strong>and my account blew up!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Not knowing what to do, I sat paralyzed in my home office chair, only getting up once to pick up a call on my landline phone. It was a gentleman from TD Ameritrade - my broker at the time.</p>
          <p>Reality soon began to set in, and I realized this call was the last call any trader ever wanted to receive. I was getting margin called, and I needed to liquidate my positions. My stomach sank, thinking I had just lost years of growing my assets, my trading account, and my life savings.</p>
          <p><strong><em>But, it was worse…</em></strong>;</p>
          <p>Not only did I have to close all of my positions due to massive losses but the broker also told me that I owed $125,000 on top of what I had already lost!</p>
          <p>As you can imagine, I was in bad shape and desperate: I had to borrow against my credit cards to pay off my broker. My stress spiked just as hard as the market crashed. It was so bad that the asthma I had as a child suddenly came back - decades after I last experienced it.</p>
          <p>Here I was, 38 years old, with a wife and four children. I had started trading in the markets with the dream of providing for my family and retiring early. Instead, I was in debt, I had 15 no trading capital, and now I had to walk around, not only with my self-imposed shame but also with an inhaler in my pocket for my newfound asthma.</p>
          <p>It was my ultimate low point. It was hard for me to admit at the time, but after many years of studying, I clearly didn’t know what I needed to know to make money in ALL market environments.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, I was beaten down but not broken. I used this painful moment as a catalyst for what would be another 10- year journey to re-educate myself on what it actually takes to trade options for a living. Now, because I never want you to be in the position I found myself in, I am writing this book to share with you the lessons, principles, and tactics I’ve uncovered along the way.</p>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
          <p class="center-text">&nbsp;<strong>Rising From the Ashes</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Blowing up your account and going into debt will turn you into a different person. I knew that if I was to ever have success with trading, I needed to arm myself with a different set of tools, beliefs, and, most importantly, a set of clear, well-defined goals.</p>
          <p>It’s essential to define what success looks like to me. Trading is only worth my time and effort if it meets <strong>three key criteria:</strong></p>
			<ol>
          <li>It needs to outperform the S&amp;P on a risk-adjusted basis (otherwise, I would simply invest in an index fund).</li>
          <li>It needs to be passive. Trading should be a means to an end, not an end in itself. I only really want to spend about 20 minutes a week trading (I want to trade for a 16 living and actually live).</li>
          <li>Finally, it needs to be safe, objective, and stress-free. I want to be able to go on vacation and not necessarily have to manage my account or look at my computer all the time.</li>
			</ol>
            <p>&nbsp;<strong>Ultimatel, my goal is to seek peaceful passive trading profits:</strong></p>
          <p>Optimize For Peaceful Trading Profits</p>
          <p>What that means is I optimize for high risk-adjusted returns, market outperformance, and making money in all market types. To achieve this goal, I obviously need high returns, and therefore, I need to harness a true trading edge.</p>
          <p>Next, I need to mitigate and control risk at all costs. This means low drawdowns and being safe in crashes so I can sleep easy at night and profit without panic. Finally, I need to eliminate the hassle. By this, I mean minimizing management complexity, emotions, and mental bandwidth. I use objective trading rules and limit my trading to around 20 minutes a week.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In other words, I needed to treat trading like a business. This is when I developed my options trading laboratory.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p class="center-text"><strong>My Options Trading Laboratory</strong></p>
		  <p>In this “laboratory,” I would use a different set of tools, such as historical options data, risk graphs, quantitative analysis, and a deeper-level knowledge of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-order Greeks, to create “unconventional” trade structures and plans. This is where I would get my proverbial “10,000” hours of options education.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>During these years, I personally developed and tested 198 different trading strategies. Here are the results:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>154 of my systems did NOT produce a profit. I rejected them.</li>
			<li>I thoroughly researched the remaining 44 trading models. I spent months and months backtesting each one of them. The ones that could NOT stand up to backtesting were eliminated.</li>
			<li>My refining process led to 17 models that were promising enough to forward-test using my own money. Only eight were successful.</li>
			<li>I then took the remaining eight models and tore them apart, turned them inside out, and flipped them upside down, looking for ANY FLAW in their design.</li>
			<li>Finally, after years of testing and disregarding 190 trading models, I’ve developed the remaining eight models into legitimate, money-making, proprietary trading systems.</li>
			</ul>
		    <p>These few have become the backbone of the low-risk, market-beating “All-Market Profits” strategies that have allowed me to trade for a living <strong>(and are what you’ll learn in this book)</strong>.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>WHAT IS THE ALL-MARKET PROFITS FRAMEWORK?</b></p>
          <p>The <strong><em>“All-Market Profits” Framework (A.M.P. for short)</em></strong> is a blueprint for designing, constructing, and implementing an options trading system that can safely outperform the S&amp;P 500 and preserve capital and profit in <strong>all markets</strong>.</p>
<p>The underlying thesis of “All-Market Profit” type strategies is that the key to outperformance is to harness an extractable edge and minimize drawdowns across all different market environments.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This can be achieved by placing a hyper-efficient, proactively hedged, and properly positioned premium selling option structure within a low maintenance, mechanical, and objective trading plan - resulting in a non-directional trading system that can weather all market environments without the need to predict future price movements.</p>
			<p>The Five Pillars of the A.M.P Trading Framework that you'll learn in Part 2 of This Book:</p>
			<p>Trade Structure</p>
			<p>Leverage (Margin)</p>
			<p>Position Sizing</p>
			<p>Entry Rules</p>
		    <p>Management Rules</p>
	      <p>I’ve written this book to reveal and share with you the core components of the All-Market Profit-type strategies in the coming chapters. 19 However, at a very high level, it is a: (1) properly-sized, (2) proactively-hedged, (3) multi-legged, premium-selling-options structure that is (4) placed within a mechanical, all-encompassing rule set.</p>
	      <p>&nbsp;<strong>The All-Market Profits Trading Framework relies on several premises:</strong></p>
		    <ul>
			<li>Future price movements cannot be accurately predicted, but volatility tends to revert to the mean.</li>
			<li>The selling of options provides a statistically proven edge.</li>
			<li>Controlling higher-order Greeks is the key to weathering all markets.</li>
			</ul>
<p>We will explore these premises throughout this book and
detail why accounting for them can result in a truly non-directional
trading strategy with the ability to weather all market
environments.</p>
		  <p class="center-text"><b>WHAT IS THE TRACK RECORD*:</b></p>
			<p>I have several “All-Market Profit” type strategies. However, one of my flagship strategies has been backtested and forward- tested to roughly make twice the market returns of the S&amp;P 500 with approximately one-third of the risk.</p>
		    <p>I've included a sample equity curve below:</p>
	      <p>Since 2015, this strategy’s Compound Annual Growth Rate has been 20.99%, indicating substantial growth year over year, outpacing benchmarks such as the S&amp;P 500, which had a CAGR of approximately 10% in the same period.&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>At this rate, the account would double every three to four years compared to the S&amp;P 500, which would take ~7 to 8 years to double.</p>
		    <p>This particular strategy has maintained a relatively stable equity curve, minimizing the severity and length of drawdowns even during challenging market conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center-text"><b>DRAWDOWN MITIGATION</b></p>
		  <p>The key metrics here pertain to the risk and drawdowns.
			  Some trading strategies might make 50%+ one year only
			  to be followed by a massive 50% drawdown the next. No
			  right-minded investor wants high drawdowns like this for
			  one simple reason - it takes a 100% return to compensate
			  for a 50% drawdown. That’s why the key to long-term market
			  success is to reduce drawdowns and focus on high-risk-adjusted
			  returns.</p>
		  <p>With this particular A.M.P. Strategy, there have been no losing
			  years from 2015-2023 while keeping drawdowns low.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p> Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 had three years of losses from
			  2015 to 2023.</p>
		  <p>The large drawdown, measured as the largest peak-totrough
		    decline in the strategy’s account value, was -10.13%,
		    and it took only 14 days to recover.</p>
		  <p>Another helpful chart to visualize the minimal account volatility of an A.M.P.-style trading system is an underwater plot.</p>
		  <p>An underwater plot visually represents how far and for how long investments are “underwater” — meaning how much below the peak value they have fallen and how long they remain below that peak before recovering.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>This chart is particularly useful for illustrating an investment’s risk and recovery periods. As you can see in the underwater plot above, the magnitude and length of the drawdowns in this particular trading system are far superior to the S&amp;P 500.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p class="center-text"><b>ALL-MARKET PERFORMANCE</b></p>
		  <p>We will discuss this in further detail in Chapter 6 of this book, but what sets the All-Market Profits-type strategies apart is their ability to consistently outperform across various market environments.</p>
		  <p>At a high level, here is a quick breakdown of the common options selling market types and a snapshot of how an A.M.P.-style system performs.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>For option premium sellers, the market environment can be broken down into four categories: Sideways, Grind Downs, Rising Bulls, and Crash Market.</p>
		  <p class="center-text">The Sideways Market</p>
		  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Sideways Market is where prices fluctuate within a narrow range without forming any distinct trend upwards or downwards.</p>
		  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Sideways Market in the first six months of 2015 when the market stayed within a 4% range up or down and the VIX high was slightly above 23.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>A.M.P. Strategy Performance:</strong> From 1/2/2015 - 7/27/2015, the market (S&amp;P 500) only rose by 0.46% while the A.M.P. increased by 10.09%.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>From 7/15/2016 - 11/16/2016, the market (S&amp;P 500) only rose by 0.70% while this A.M.P. strategy increased by 5.88%.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>All-Market Profits strategies excel in sideways markets primarily due to their non-directional setup and positive Theta exposure.</p>
		  <p class="center-text">The Grind-Down Market</p>
		  <p><strong>&nbsp;Definition:</strong> A Grind-Down Market is a sustained period where the market prices decline by a certain percentage (around 10%+) over a given timeframe.</p>
		  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Grind-Down Market occurred from October 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, when the market was down 14.5% with a maximum VIX spike of approximately 25 points.</p>
		  <p><strong>A.M.P. Strategy Performance:</strong> From 9/20/2018 - 12/24/2018, the market (S&amp;P 500) drew down by -19.78% while the A.M.P. increased by 11.57%. From 1/03/2022 - 10/12/2022, the market (S&amp;P 500) drew down by -25.43% while the A.M.P. increased by 18.69%.</p>
		  <p>All-Market Profit strategies demonstrate resilience in grinddown markets by harnessing the power of the higher-order Greek known as Charm.</p>
		  <p class="center-text">The Rising Bull Market</p>
		  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Rising Bull Market can be defined as a sustained period in which the market continually rises and there is relatively low volatility.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>Example:</strong> For the entire year of 2017, there was a Rising Bull Market. The market (SPX or S&amp;P 500 stock market) rose over 19% while the highest VIX reading was under 17.5.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>A.M.P. Strategy Performance:</strong> From 12/24/2018 to 2/19/2020, the market (S&amp;P 500) rose by 44.02% while the A.M.P. rose by 14.39%. From 3/24/2020 - 1/3/2022, the market (S&amp;P 500) rose by 114.38% while the A.M.P. rose by 72.93%.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>All-Market Profit strategies perform well in bull markets primarily due to their positive Theta exposure. As the market rises, the strategy benefits from time decay while maintaining a non-directional stance, allowing it to capture profits without relying on directional bets.</p>
		  <p class="center-text">The Crash Market</p>
		  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A crash market is a sudden and significant drop in stock prices, typically defined as a decline of about 10% or more within a few days.</p>
		  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Crash Market occurred in August 2015 when the market dropped 13.13% in four days and the VIX went from 15 to over 53, a 38-point spike. Another Crash Market occurred in early February 2018 when the market fell over 10.5% in seven days and the VIX went from 12.5 to over 50 in four days. More recently, The March 2020 COVID Crash saw The S&amp;P 500 drop by approximately 34% in just over a month. Simultaneously, the VIX soared, jumping from around 15 to a peak of 82.69.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>A.M.P. Strategy Performance:</strong> In the flash crash of August 2015, the S&amp;P500 spiraled nearly 11% while the A.M.P. gained 5.41% in the same period. Then, in the crash of February 2018, the market dropped nearly 8.5% while this strategy gained 5.33%. Finally, in the COVID crash, the market dropped nearly 34% while this strategy only drew down 2.27%. All-Market Profit strategies exhibit remarkable resilience in crash markets due to their proactive hedging and long volatility exposure. By incorporating strategic hedges and harnessing the power of Vomma, these strategies can potentially generate profits, even during sharp market declines.</p>
		  <p class="center-text"><b>Trading For A Living</b></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p> These performance metrics are historical snapshots of just

			<ol>
<li>The All-Market Profits (A.M.P.) Trading Framework was
born out of my personal journey toward trading for a living
and the painful lessons I learned along the way my
experience highlighted the need for a truly non-directional
system that could preserve capital in all market
environments while achieving outsized risk-adjusted
returns.</li>
			<li>All-Market Profits-style Trading systems rely on several
				premises
			<ol>
				<li>Future price movements cannot be accurately predicted, but volatility reversion can</li>
				<li>The selling of options provides astatistically proven edge</li>
				<li>That edge is incomplete due to direction and volatility risk</li>
				<li>Controlling higher-order Greeks is the key to weathering all markets.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>At the core of any all-market profits strategy is its performance across all four primary options-selling market types: rising bull markets, sideways markets, grinddown bear markets, and crash markets. By adapting to changing market conditions and employing robust risk management techniques, this A.M.P.-style strategy can generate strong risk-adjusted returns with lower drawdowns compared to traditional investment benchmarks.</li>
			<li>In Part 2 of this book, we will dive deep into the specific mechanics and principles behind the All-Market Profit Trading strategies. From trade structuring and Greek management to adaptation and risk control, this book will provide a comprehensive roadmap for implementing this powerful options selling approach.</li>

          <h2>Chapter 2: Who Is This Book For? The Battle-Scarred Trader</h2>
          <p>As I shared in the previous chapter, my journey to successful
              options trading was a long, frustrating process filled with
              countless hours of trial and error. I didn’t have a family member,
              friend, or traditional “mentor” to show me the ropes.</p>
          <p>Even worse, an overwhelming majority of the online trading courses I took were useless. They were taught by an untrustworthy instructor who failed to show their P&amp;L - because they were, in fact, unprofitable.</p>
          <p>Once I figured out how to trade for a living with my “All-Market Profits” strategies, I began showcasing my trading results on YouTube in an effort to help other traders avoid the pitfalls and challenges I faced. By sharing the P&amp;L of all my accounts every week, I aimed to prove the effectiveness of my systems and inspire other “real trading educators” to follow suit.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Then, in 2020, due to demand from my channel followers, I started teaching my trading and investing approaches to other interested traders. Though I’ve now taught my All-Market Profit strategies to traders from all over the world, I noticed that there was one common thread - nearly everyone is what I call a “battle- scarred” trader.</p>
			<p class="center-text">This book is for you if you are a "Battle-Scarred Trader"</p>
		  <p>A battle-scarred trader is an individual who has been through
			  the gauntlet of education courses and trading strategies
			  only to come out disillusioned. Like me, they had faced similar
			  struggles and challenges on their trading journeys, often
			  feeling lost, frustrated, and unsure of where to turn for genuine
			  guidance and support.</p>
		  <p>They are sold on the idea of trading as a means to produce
			  passive income but have either yet to become consistently
			  profitable or are seeking better strategies than what they
			  are currently employing.</p>
		  <p>Battle-scarred traders come in all shapes and sizes.</p>
		  <p>Some are in retirement or approaching retirement and aim
			  to preserve their capital at all costs, potentially trade for a
			  living, and bankroll their sunset years.</p>
		  <p>Others are 9-5ers who can’t sit at their computer all day to
			  trade. They need a trading approach that integrates with
			  their busy professional lives.</p>
		  <p>A vast majority of battle-scarred traders are people who are
or were option premium sellers who’ve been through crashes
and learned the hard way to prioritize “risk-adjusted” returns
over the trap of “high-win rates.”</p>
		  <p>Then, there’s a minority of battle-scarred traders who are
			  already very profitable and have built up an extensive portfolio
			  but want a diversification strategy for lasting passive
			  income and wealth.</p>
		  <p>My question: are you a battle-scarred trader?</p>
		  <p>If so, you are not alone.</p>
			<p>This book and the framework revealed within are suitable
			  for you if you wish to inch one step closer to lasting market
			  success.
			  But, don’t just take my word for it…
			  Here are examples from past clients on how All-Market Profit
			  strategies can be tailored to fit your unique trading and Investing
			  goals:</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text">Marcel - Fitting Trading into His Busy 9-5</p>
			<p>Marcel is a business professional from Germany. As a business
development manager for an American company, his
				work responsibilities kept him extremely busy.</p>
<p>His previous trading experience included a mix of long stock
strategies and various unhedged options selling strategies
like cash-secured puts and covered calls. However, these
methods had some key limitations:</p>
			<ul><li>The time commitment often clashed with his professional
responsibilities, leaving him unable to adequately
				monitor and adjust positions during the workday.</li>
			<li>Individual stock positions carried too much single-company
risk exposure. Diversifying across many stocks
				solved this but became too time-consuming to manage.</li>
				<li>He felt he was too often at the mercy of the market, unable
to control drawdowns during volatility spikes and
downturns. This left him stressed and losing sleep.</li></ul>
			<p>That’s why the minimal time required and risk control of
non-directional options strategies (like what you’ll learn in
this book) appealed to him. After implementing the A.M.P.
approach, Marcel found that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>He only needed 30 minutes per week to manage his
portfolio, which seamlessly fit into his busy professional
life. This freed up his workday and eliminated trade
				management stress.</li>
<li>The defined risk and proactive hedging gave him peace
of mind. He could handle his job responsibilities without
	worrying about catastrophic losses decimating his account.</li>
				<li>The consistent, stable returns, while not shooting for
“home runs,” gave him confidence in reaching his financial
goals over time without disrupting his career or
family life.</li></ul>
			<p>In Marcel’s own words, “It’s easier than you think... You can
do this next to your regular job and still make a very good
				amount of money in a very safe way.”</p>
<p>By making the switch to non-directional options trading,
Marcel gained not only better risk-adjusted returns but invaluable
	peace of mind and work-life balance.</p>
<p>If you also value consistent, low-stress profits that don’t hijack
your daily schedule, focus on Chapter 7, which details
building an optimized options structure, and Chapter 7.5 on
managing the strategy in just minutes each week.</p>

			<p class="center-text"><b>Martin - Guarding and Growing His Nest Egg</b></p>
			<p>Martin is a retiree currently living in Durham, North Carolina.
Like many battle-scarred traders, he went through several
trading education services over the years, such as tastytrade,
but ultimately became jaded with the complexity, lack
				of transparency, and lackluster results of their strategies.</p>
<p>His core goal was simple but essential for someone in retirement:
preserve his capital at all costs and achieve steady
returns of 10%-15% per year without the stress of large drawdowns
so he and his wife could enjoy their golden years
	with greater peace of mind.</p>
<p>After discovering the All-Market Profits approach, Martin
found that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The extensive backtesting across various market conditions
gave him confidence the strategy could deliver reliable
returns with tolerable drawdowns. No more wide
				swings or sleepless nights.</li>
				<li>The clear, objective trade rules eliminated the guess-
work and subjectivity that plagued his previous strategies.
					He could finally trade with consistency and conviction.</li>
				<li>The minimal time commitment allowed him to still travel
and live life without being glued to his screens all day.
20 minutes a day was all he needed to manage his retirement
nest egg.</li></ul>
			<p>In Martin’s words, “I’m at an age where I can’t have the mindset
that I can go down 30% because I’ve got time to make it
up. Well, no - I don’t have time to make it up. This discipline
				is exactly what I was looking for.”</p>
<p>By gaining a proven system to grow his nest egg with greater
stability and less stress, Martin has been able to spend
less time worrying about the markets and more time enjoying
retirement with his wife - including a trip to Rome where
he was so eager to get started he signed up for the program
	from his hotel room.</p>
<p>If steady, stress-free returns are your priority, focus on Chapters
7 and 8 to discover how to create an All-Market Profits
strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and retirement lifestyle
goals. You can guard and grow your nest egg in retirement
without sacrificing your well-being or precious time.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Brian - Finally on the Path to Profitable Trading</b></p>
			<p>Brian is an intelligent, hard-working hospital software support
analyst with a decade of experience trading options,
stocks, and futures - yet, he had never had a profitable year.
This left him disillusioned with the flashy promises but lackluster
				results of other strategies and programs.</p>
<p>After discovering the All-Market Profits trading, Brian found
that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The extensive backtesting across various market conditions
gave him confidence the strategy could deliver reliable
returns. He finally had a plan he could trust, even
				when trades went against him.</li>
				<li>The clear, objective trade rules provided the consistency
and simplicity he craved. No more blindly following
					gurus and jumping from method to method.</li>
				<li>The minimal time commitment fit his busy professional
life. He didn’t have to be glued to his screens all day to
manage his portfolio.</li></ul>
			<p>In Brian’s words, “Now, I have a plan that I trust. I see the
market conditions, and I’m not worried because I have the
history to back it up. I’m finally on the path to my first profitable
				year in trading.”</p>
<p>By gaining a proven system he could implement with consistency
and confidence, Brian has been able to stop chasing
the latest trading fads and instead focus on executing a reliable
plan for long-term wealth building.</p>
<p>To discover the trading plan Brian is using to target his first
profitable year, dive into Chapter 7 and start building your
All-Market Profits portfolio. You can break the cycle of trading
losses and start down a more peaceful, proven path.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Bogdan and the Need to Hedge</b></p>
			<p>Bogdan, a principal software engineer manager at Microsoft,
had a clear vision for his trading. He aimed to find a strategy
to safeguard his investments from market volatility, avoiding
				the risks of large drawdowns and account blow-ups.</p>
<p>In his early trading days, Bogdan explored various strategies
but often found them lacking safety measures - particularly
that they were not properly hedged against black swan
	events.</p>
<p>When asked about the All-Market Profits approach, Bogdan
said,
“The most valuable thing that you brought me is that basically
everything is hedged. I haven’t seen one structure,
one trading structure that you are talking about that is not
hedged. I’m a very safe guy. I don’t want to blow up my account
	in the next year.”</p>
<p>Hedging is a critical component of the All-Market Profits
strategies. The proactively hedged options structure taught
in Chapter 7.1 is designed to protect capital during volatility
	spikes and market crashes.</p>
<p>By deploying this “always hedged” approach, Bogdan can
more confidently navigate market turmoil, helping him stay
	the course and avoid emotionally driven mistakes.</p>
<p>If minimizing drawdowns is a priority in your trading, study
Chapter 6 to understand how the All-Market Profits strategies
harness the Greeks to remain truly non-directional.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Mark - Protecting and Growing His Retirement Portfolio</b></p>
			<p>Mark is an experienced options trader living in Brazil with an
				extensive background in spread trading.</p>
<p>Now in his late 50s and nearing retirement, his perspective
and priorities have shifted. The market volatility and lessons
of the dot-com crash, the 2008 financial crisis, and the 2022
	downturn have made capital preservation a key focus.</p>
<p>After following my YouTube channel and trades for a couple
of years and seeing their resiliency during 2022, Mark decided
to enroll in the mastermind program. He found that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The non-directional, hedged strategy aligned with his
goal of generating steady returns while limiting downside
risk. It was a welcome change from his previous
directional spreads that performed well in up markets
				but suffered during corrections.</li>
<li>The systematic trade entry and management rules
made implementation simple and unobtrusive. Mark
could check his portfolio in 5 minutes each day and not
	be glued to his screens.</li>
<li>The extensive backtesting and live teaching gave him
the confidence to deploy the strategy in his own account.
Seeing the rules in action and having guardrails
in place eased any lingering skepticism.</li></ul>
			<p>In Mark’s words, “This provides the kind of diversification
				in a portfolio that you need without being too directional.</p>
<p>When you’re close to retirement with a sizable account, you
can’t put all your eggs in one basket and risk everything like
	when you were younger.”</p>
<p>By reallocating a portion of his portfolio to the All-Market
Profits type strategies, Mark aims to achieve “outsized
risk-adjusted returns” heading into retirement, capturing
healthy profits during good times while defending against
	deep drawdowns.</p>
<p>He plans to increase his allocation to potentially half his
	portfolio or more over time.</p>
<p>To see how a strategy designed for steady performance in
all market environments could help bulletproof your retirement
portfolio, review the 4 key market regimes covered in
Chapters 6-8. Then, put the pieces together in Chapters 6-8
to build an “All-Market” approach of your own.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Nathaniel - Discovering a Life-Changing, Stress-Free Trading Strategy</b></p>
			<p>Nathaniel is a self-employed trader from Connecticut who
has been actively involved in the stock market since graduating
college in 2019. His trading experience spans longterm
investing, swing trading, day trading, and non-directional
				options strategies.</p>
<p>Despite his mathematical background and intermediate-level
understanding of options trading, Nathaniel struggled to
find a reliable, stress-free approach to building wealth in the
	markets.</p>
<p>After following my work for several years and successfully
implementing his other trading strategies, Nathaniel decided
to enroll in the All-Market Profits mentorship program.
	The experience was transformative.</p>
<p>In Nathaniel’s own words, “I swear I’m not exaggerating. It
really feels like there’s a little bit of a light at the end of the
tunnel in terms of being able to relax a little bit, work a little
less, and be away from my computer a little bit more. For
the first time in a long time, I’m really feeling like this strategy
could really change my life. I’m going to trade this for
	decades.”</p>
<p><b>The key benefits Nathaniel found in the All-Market Profits
	trading include:</b></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The extensive backtesting across various market conditions
gave him unshakeable confidence in the strategy’s
durability and long-term profitability. Unlike his previous
trading systems that quickly lost their edge, the
				AMS methodology had proven resilient year after year.</li>
				<li>The systematic, rules-based approach removed the
stress and subjectivity of his active trading days. Nathaniel
could now manage his portfolio with minimal
					time commitment without being glued to his screens.</li>
				<li>The strategy’s defensive nature and lower drawdowns
aligned perfectly with his risk-averse nature. As a longterm
investor, Nathaniel appreciated how the AMS approach
offered steadier returns than buy-and-hold with
far milder drawdowns.</li></ul>
			<p>Nathaniel plans to allocate up to two-thirds of his net worth
to the All-Market Profits trading strategies with the goal of
potentially increasing that allocation up to 100% as his confidence
in navigating margin expansion grows. He sees this
not just as an investing strategy but as a vehicle to achieve
his early retirement goals by generating reliable, stress-free
				passive income.</p>
<p>For long-term investors seeking a more peaceful, profitable
alternative to the roller coaster of buy-and-hold, explore
how the All-Market Profit’s strategies and unique usage of
options Greeks (Chapter 6) and strategic trade structure
(Chapter 7) can help you escape the “work until you’re 65”
	grind and retire on your own terms.</p>
<p>Those case studies are just a sample of the dozens of client
videos I’ve recorded and you can watch each interview on
	my website.</p>
<p>The battle-scarred traders I’ve taught my trading approaches
to all have to seek transparency, backtests, and performance
evaluations. They desire realistic returns while prioritizing
risk management and they want independence and
	self-sufficiency as a trader.</p>
			<p><b>But, what about your trading?</b></p>
<p>As unique as each trader’s path is, there are core questions
that can help you assess whether the All-Market Profits strategies
will align with your specific trading aspirations and current
	situation.</p>
<p>The following questions are designed to prompt reflection
on key aspects of your trading approach and to evaluate if
the principles you’ll learn in this book correspond to your
	needs and expectations.</p>
<p>Take a moment to answer the following questions, and remember,
it’s not just about understanding the strategy but
also about recognizing your individual trading style, goals,
and challenges.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Battle Scarred Trader Questionnaire</b></p>
			<p>Answer the following questions honestly to determine if
All-Market Profits trading aligns with your trading goals and
challenges. Rate each statement on a scale from 1 to 5,
where 1 means “strongly disagree” and 5 means “strongly
agree.”</p>
<p>Once you’ve rated yourself for each statement, total up your
