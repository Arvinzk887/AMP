          <h2>Chapter 2: Who Is This Book For? The Battle-Scarred Trader</h2>
          <p>As I shared in the previous chapter, my journey to successful
              options trading was a long, frustrating process filled with
              countless hours of trial and error. I didn’t have a family member,
              friend, or traditional “mentor” to show me the ropes.</p>
          <p>Even worse, an overwhelming majority of the online trading courses I took were useless. They were taught by an untrustworthy instructor who failed to show their P&amp;L - because they were, in fact, unprofitable.</p>
          <p>Once I figured out how to trade for a living with my “All-Market Profits” strategies, I began showcasing my trading results on YouTube in an effort to help other traders avoid the pitfalls and challenges I faced. By sharing the P&amp;L of all my accounts every week, I aimed to prove the effectiveness of my systems and inspire other “real trading educators” to follow suit.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Then, in 2020, due to demand from my channel followers, I started teaching my trading and investing approaches to other interested traders. Though I’ve now taught my All-Market Profit strategies to traders from all over the world, I noticed that there was one common thread - nearly everyone is what I call a “battle- scarred” trader.</p>
			<p class="center-text">This book is for you if you are a "Battle-Scarred Trader"</p>
		  <p>A battle-scarred trader is an individual who has been through
			  the gauntlet of education courses and trading strategies
			  only to come out disillusioned. Like me, they had faced similar
			  struggles and challenges on their trading journeys, often
			  feeling lost, frustrated, and unsure of where to turn for genuine
			  guidance and support.</p>
		  <p>They are sold on the idea of trading as a means to produce
			  passive income but have either yet to become consistently
			  profitable or are seeking better strategies than what they
			  are currently employing.</p>
		  <p>Battle-scarred traders come in all shapes and sizes.</p>
		  <p>Some are in retirement or approaching retirement and aim
			  to preserve their capital at all costs, potentially trade for a
			  living, and bankroll their sunset years.</p>
		  <p>Others are 9-5ers who can’t sit at their computer all day to
			  trade. They need a trading approach that integrates with
			  their busy professional lives.</p>
		  <p>A vast majority of battle-scarred traders are people who are
or were option premium sellers who’ve been through crashes
and learned the hard way to prioritize “risk-adjusted” returns
over the trap of “high-win rates.”</p>
		  <p>Then, there’s a minority of battle-scarred traders who are
			  already very profitable and have built up an extensive portfolio
			  but want a diversification strategy for lasting passive
			  income and wealth.</p>
		  <p>My question: are you a battle-scarred trader?</p>
		  <p>If so, you are not alone.</p>
			<p>This book and the framework revealed within are suitable
			  for you if you wish to inch one step closer to lasting market
			  success.
			  But, don’t just take my word for it…
			  Here are examples from past clients on how All-Market Profit
			  strategies can be tailored to fit your unique trading and Investing
			  goals:</p>
