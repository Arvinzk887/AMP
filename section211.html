          <p class="center-text">The Rising Bull Market</p>
		  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Rising Bull Market can be defined as a sustained period in which the market continually rises and there is relatively low volatility.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>Example:</strong> For the entire year of 2017, there was a Rising Bull Market. The market (SPX or S&amp;P 500 stock market) rose over 19 percent while the highest VIX reading was under 17 point 5.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>A.M.P. Strategy Performance:</strong> From December 24, 2018 to February 19, 2020, the market (S&amp;P 500) rose by 44 point zero two percent while the A.M.P. rose by 14 point three nine percen . From March 24, 2020 to January 3, 2020, the market (S&amp;P 500) rose by 114 point three eight percent while the A.M.P. rose by 72 point nine three percent.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>All-Market Profit strategies perform well in bull markets primarily due to their positive Theta exposure. As the market rises, the strategy benefits from time decay while maintaining a non-directional stance, allowing it to capture profits without relying on directional bets.</p>
		  <p class="center-text">The Crash Market</p>
		  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A crash market is a sudden and significant drop in stock prices, typically defined as a decline of about 10% or more within a few days.</p>
		  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Crash Market occurred in August 2015 when the market dropped 13 point one three percent in four days and the VIX went from 15 to over 53, a 38-point spike. Another Crash Market occurred in early February 2018 when the market fell over 10 point 5 percent in seven days and the VIX went from 12 point 5 to over 50 in four days. More recently, The March 2020 COVID Crash saw The S&amp;P 500 drop by approximately 34 percent in just over a month. Simultaneously, the VIX soared, jumping from around 15 to a peak of 82 point six nine.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>A.M.P. Strategy Performance:</strong> In the flash crash of August 2015, the S&amp;P 500 spiraled nearly 11 percent while the A.M.P. gained 5 point four one percent in the same period. Then, in the crash of February 2018, the market dropped nearly 8 point 5 percent while this strategy gained 5 point three three percent. Finally, in the COVID crash, the market dropped nearly 34 percent while this strategy only drew down 2 point two seven percent. All-Market Profit strategies exhibit remarkable resilience in crash markets due to their proactive hedging and long volatility exposure. By incorporating strategic hedges and harnessing the power of Vomma, these strategies can potentially generate profits, even during sharp market declines.</p>
		  <p class="center-text"><b>Trading For A Living</b></p>
			<p> These performance metrics are historical snapshots of just
			  one of my flagship All-Market Profits trading strategies. I hope they paint a compelling picture as to why the approaches
			  you will learn in this book can be suitable for traders seeking reliable growth and stability in their portfolios.</p>
		  <p> Combining high returns with mitigated drawdowns and performance
			  in all market conditions has empowered me to
			  trade for a living. More important than that is that I am now
			  able to spend my time where and how I choose.</p>
		  <p>As we move forward in this book, you’ll gain an understanding
			  of the principles needed for constructing your own
			  All-Market Profits strategy, tailored to your unique needs and
			  risk tolerance so you can build your own successful trading
			  business.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Once again (and as a gentle reminder), in order to get the
			  most out of this book, it is assumed you have intermediate
			  to&nbsp; advanced options trading understanding. If the terms
			  “CAGR,” “put,” “calls,” “Deltas,” or “butterfly” mean nothing
			  to you, I have a helpful companion video training program to
			  help complement the concepts taught in this book.

			<p class="center-text">Key Chapter Takeaways</p>
			<ol>
<li>The All-Market Profits (A.M.P.) Trading Framework was
born out of my personal journey toward trading for a living
and the painful lessons I learned along the way my
experience highlighted the need for a truly non-directional
system that could preserve capital in all market
environments while achieving outsized risk-adjusted
returns.</li>
			<li>All-Market Profits-style Trading systems rely on several
				premises
			<ol>
				<li>Future price movements cannot be accurately predicted, but volatility reversion can</li>
				<li>The selling of options provides astatistically proven edge</li>
				<li>That edge is incomplete due to direction and volatility risk</li>
				<li>Controlling higher-order Greeks is the key to weathering all markets.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>At the core of any all-market profits strategy is its performance across all four primary options-selling market types: rising bull markets, sideways markets, grinddown bear markets, and crash markets. By adapting to changing market conditions and employing robust risk management techniques, this A.M.P.-style strategy can generate strong risk-adjusted returns with lower drawdowns compared to traditional investment benchmarks.</li>
			<li>In Part 2 of this book, we will dive deep into the specific mechanics and principles behind the All-Market Profit Trading strategies. From trade structuring and Greek management to adaptation and risk control, this book will provide a comprehensive roadmap for implementing this powerful options selling approach.</li>
