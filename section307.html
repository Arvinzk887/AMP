			<p class="center-text">The #1 Way to Determine If An Educator is Legitmate</p>
		  <p>After devoting hundreds of hours to vetting other trading educators,
				I’ve determined:</p>
<p><strong><em>The only way to prove if an expert is credible and, more
importantly profitable, is to have them share their profit
and loss.</em></strong></p>
<p>Simply put, if a trading educator doesn’t show their real profit
and loss from a REPUTABLE brokerage account (ideally
accompanied with a screen recording of their transaction
history along with underlying trades), then why should you
	trust them?</p>
<p>Again, I believe that if an instructor makes promises in their
marketing, they should prove their credibility by sharing the
real P&amp;L of their entire portfolio on a consistent basis. Also,
	it’s helpful to see a profit and loss per underlying trade.</p>
<p><strong>So, why don’t educators share their P&amp;L if, by doing so,
they could immediately prove their credibility?</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>They Aren’t Profitable</strong> - Most trading educators simply
do not have a verifiable track record of profitability
				since inception.The instructor or trader will simply
“cherry pick” their winners and hide the losers - never
consistently sharing their verifiable portfolio P&amp;L. If they
do share their P&amp;L, it might only be a spreadsheet that
is easy to fudge, or they might not share their full account
			  statement since inception.</li>
<li><strong>It’s Easier to Sell Shovels in a Gold Rush</strong> - Selling online
courses can be likened to the Gold Rush where selling
tools (shovels) was often more profitable than searching
for gold itself. I’ll be the first to admit that selling educational
courses is a lucrative business model provided
the promises are upheld. The unfortunate reality is that
more educators are more skilled in marketing - not in
	trading - therefore, their promises are often not upheld.</li>
<li><strong>Common Sense Often Takes a Backseat When Greed
Enters the Picture</strong> - Emotions can cloud judgment when
the allure of quick profits is dangled before aspiring
traders. Educators exploit this by focusing on marketing
strategies that play into these emotions. This leads to
potential students ignoring the red flags, such as a lack
of transparency in profit and loss statements.</li>
		  </ul>
			<p>The broader implication here is pretty sobering: transparency
simply isn’t compatible with the business model of most
trading educators, yet it should be of paramount concern for
				the student.</p>
<p>Again, I implore you to do your own research. Reach out to
other educators and ask for their P&amp;L. You’ll be stunned by
the number of educators who flat out won’t share their statements
or will share only a snapshot of their accounts. Don’t
let their seemingly legitimate excuses fool you.</p>
			<p class="center-text">So... How Can You Find The Real P&amp;L of My Strategies?</p>
			<p>By now I hope you understand the importance of
verifying the performance of any trading strategy
or educator you follow. That’s why, since 2019, I
have been publicly sharing the net liquidation value
and “REAL P&amp;L” of my own trading accounts on
				my YouTube channel.</p>
<p>By posting regular updates, including weekly performance
reports, trade analyses, and educational
content, I aim to provide a clear, unfiltered view of
how the All-Market Trading Solution performs in real-
	time, across various market conditions.</p>
<p>While past performance is never a guarantee of future
results, I hope that this level of transparency
allows you, as a reader and potential student, to
assess the effectiveness and reliability of my strategies
yourself.</p>
