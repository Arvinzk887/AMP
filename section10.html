			<h2>Chapter 7 point 2: Wisely Employ Leverage (Margin)</h2>
			<p>Used properly, margin is one of the most valuable tools in a
trader’s arsenal. Most traders are familiar with Regular Margin
or Reg-T margin however, In this chapter, we will explore
the advantages of employing Portfolio Margin and/or SPAN
margin to better weather market events, diversify your portfolio,
				and potentially yield greater returns.</p>
			<p><b>Understanding SPAN and Portfolio Margin</b></p>
<p>SPAN and Portfolio Margin are risk-based margin calculation
methods that differ from the traditional Reg-T margin used
by most brokers. While Reg-T margin calculates the margin
requirement based on the full risk of the trade at expiration,
	SPAN and Portfolio Margin take a more nuanced approach.</p>
<p>These advanced margin types consider factors such as the
probability of the trade reaching certain profit and loss levels,
the time to expiration, and the overall risk of the portfolio. By
taking a more holistic view of your positions, SPAN and Portfolio
Margin can often result in lower margin requirements,
allowing you to make better use of your trading capital.</p>
			<p><b>The Types of Margin</b></p>
			<ol>
			<li><b>Reg-T Margin (Regular Margin):</b>
				<p>Reg-T margin is the standard margin used by most brokers.
It provides 2:1 leverage, meaning that for every $1
in your account, you can control $2 worth of positions.
However, the Reg-T margin <strong>calculates the margin requirement
based on the full risk of the trade</strong> at expiration,
which can limit your buying power and potential
returns.</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Portfolio Margin:</b>
				<p>Portfolio Margin is a risk-based margin calculation that
assesses the overall risk of your portfolio, rather than
looking at each position in isolation. This approach can
lead to lower margin requirements, allowing you to
maximize your buying power and potentially increase
your returns. To qualify for Portfolio Margin, you typically
need a minimum account balance of $100,000 and to
pass a broker-specific eligibility test.</p>
				</li>
			<li><b>SPAN Margin:</b>
				<p>SPAN Margin - which is an acronym for Standard Portfolio
Analysis of Risk - is another risk-based margin calculation
method specifically designed for futures and
options on futures. Like Portfolio Margin, SPAN Margin
evaluates the overall risk of your portfolio and can result
in lower margin requirements compared to Reg-T
margin. SPAN Margin is typically available to traders
with capital of $2,000 or more, making it an attractive
option for those trading futures options.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><b>Rule of Thumb for Calculating Margin Requirements</b></p>
			<p>Before I get into the advantages of utilizing SPAN and/or
Portfolio Margin, it is first important to understand how brokers
typically calculate margin. All brokers have a different
formula for calculating margin however here is a quick rule
of thumb for calculating ballpark Portfolio Margin requirements.
SPAN margin is typically universally calculated by the
CME. Below is a quick rule of thumb for calculating both.</p>
			<p>The above risk graph of an unbalanced Iron Condor gives
a visual picture of the different margin calculations. Using
a regular margin, the lowest point of the expiration line is
Arrow #4 ($12,000). Arrow #5 ($2,000) points to the upper
expiration line. This line would not be used to calculate the
regular margin in this example because it has a higher value
(approximately $2,000) compared to the lower expiration
line (Arrow #4) at approximately $12,000. In this example,
a typical regular margin requirement would be around
				$12,000.</p>
<p>To calculate the approximate Portfolio margin OR SPAN margin,
three variables come into play. The variables are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The negative 20% slice at the T plus 0 (Circle number 1).</li>
				<li>The negative 12% slice at the T plus 0 (Circle number 2).</li>
				<li>The +10% slice at the T plus 0 (Circle number 3).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The negative 20% slice (Circle number 1) has an added calculation of dividing
by two. The margin requirement will be based on the
				lowest of the three variables:</p>
			<p><b>Variable number 1</b> - The negative 20% slice (Circle number 1) is calculated as the
				approximate P&amp;L value of negative $8,000 divided by 2 = negative $4,000.</p>
			<p><b>Variable number 2</b> - The negative 12% Slice (Circle number 2) has an approximate
				P&amp;L value of negative $5,000.</p>
			<p><b>Variable number 3</b> - The positive 10% Slice (Circle number 3) has an approximate
				P&amp;L value of negative $1,750.</p>
<p>The approximate Portfolio margin or SPAN margin for this
position is currently the highest number of the three variables.
	That would be variable #2 with a value of $5,000.</p>
<p>In order to put this position on, you would need approximately
$5,000 in the account. If you had a regular margin,
you would need approximately $12,000 in the account. You
can see that Portfolio and SPAN margins allow the account
more leverage.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Advantage number 1 of SPAN/Portfolio Margin: Early
Management, High Return Optimization</p>
			<p>One of the most significant advantages of using SPAN or
Portfolio Margin is the potential for higher returns on your
capital/margin compared to traditional Reg-T margin. By allowing
you to utilize more of your capital for trading, these
margin types enable you to optimize your returns through
				early management of your positions.</p>
<p>To illustrate the return on capital advantage, let’s consider
a hypothetical example based on the margin calculation we
highlighted in the previous section for an unbalanced Iron
Condor.</p>
			<table>
			<th></th><th>Margin or Buying
Power Used</th><th>Profit Target</th><th>% Return</th>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Regular
Margin</b></td><td>$12,000</td><td>$1,000</td><td>8.33%</td>
				</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Portfolio or
SPAN Margin</b></td><td>$5,000</td><td>$1,000</td><td>20.00%</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>In this example, a trader using Reg-T margin would need
to allocate $12,000 in buying power to enter a trade with a
profit target of $1,000. If the trade reaches its profit target,
				the trader would realize an 8.33% return on the margin used.</p>
<p>However, a trader using SPAN or Portfolio Margin might only
need to allocate $5,000 in buying power for the same trade,
due to the more favorable margin calculations. <strong>If the trade
reaches its $1,000 profit target, the trader will achieve a
	significantly higher return of 20.00% on the margin used.</strong></p>
<p>The lower margin requirements of SPAN/Portfolio Margin allow
you to manage your trades more efficiently. <strong>With less
capital tied up in each trade, you can close out positions
when they reach their profit targets early rather than waiting
	until expiration and make more efficient use of capital.</strong></p>
<p>This early management approach can be particularly beneficial
in situations where the market moves in your favor
early on, allowing you to lock in profits and free up capital
for other opportunities. By actively managing your positions
before they reach expiration, you can optimize your returns
and make more efficient use of your trading capital.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Advantage Number 2 of SPAN/Portfolio Margin: Increased
Flexibility in Trade Selection</p>
			<p>The increased buying power afforded by SPAN and Portfolio
Margin also allows you to be more flexible in which option
trade structure you can employ. With more capital at your
disposal, you can consider a wider range of strategies and
take advantage of opportunities that may have been out of
				reach with Reg-T margin.</p>
<p>For example, you may be able to take on more complex,
multi-leg options strategies that require higher margin requirements,
such as unsymmetrical options strategies.
These strategies can offer unique risk-reward profiles and
	help you navigate various market conditions more effectively.</p>
<p>The increased flexibility in trade selection, combined with
the potential for early management and higher returns on
capital, makes SPAN and Portfolio Margin powerful tools for
options traders looking to optimize their performance and
adapt to changing market conditions.</p>
			<p class="center-text">Advantage Number 3 of SPAN/Portfolio Margin: Profit
Stacking</p>
			<p>Another significant advantage of using SPAN or Portfolio
Margin is the ability to “double dip” or “profit stack.” This
means you can effectively use your buying power to trade
an efficient options structure on top of going long on other
				assets, such as bonds or stocks.</p>
<p>For example, if you had $100,000 in starting capital, you
could buy $100,000 worth of treasury bonds yielding 1-4%
or more per year and still have around $99,000 available to
trade options. This essentially allows you to have $100,000
in your account while trading with $200,000, effectively
doubling your buying power.</p>
			<p>When it comes to profit stacking with equities, according to
Charles Schwab, when using Portfolio or SPAN margin, it is
possible to use 100% of your capital to go long stocks or
indices (e.g., SPY) and then use an additional 85% to trade
				options.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that margin levels and requirements
can change with fluctuations in stock prices. For
example, if you had an account size of $100,000 and used
85% of the capital to trade options, a 10% drop in SPY would
result in a net liquidation value of $90,000. In this case, 85%
	of $90,000 would be $76,500 available for options trading.</p>
<p>To mitigate the risk of margin calls due to fluctuations in
stock prices, it’s advisable to use a more conservative approach
when profit stacking with equities. A good rule of
thumb is to use no more than 50% of your planned capital to
	trade options when going long stocks simultaneously.</p>
			<p><b>Potential Risks and Considerations</b></p>
<p>While the advantages of SPAN and Portfolio Margin are significant,
it’s essential to understand the potential risks and
considerations associated with these margin types.</p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>Increased Leverage and Risk:</strong> The increased buying
power offered by SPAN and Portfolio Margin also comes
with increased leverage and potential risk. If your positions
move against you, the losses can be amplified and
you may face the risk of a margin call or forced liquidation.</li>
				<li><strong>Margin Expansion:</strong> As market conditions change, the
margin requirements for your positions may increase,
a phenomenon known as margin expansion. This can
lead to a reduction in your buying power and potentially
force you to close positions or add more capital to your
account to meet margin requirements.</li>
				<li><strong>Complexity and Monitoring:</strong> Using SPAN or Portfolio
Margin requires a deeper understanding of margin calculations
and risk management. You’ll need to closely
monitor your positions, margin requirements, and account
balance to ensure that you’re not overexposed
to risk.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Conclusion</p>
			<p>SPAN and Portfolio Margin offer options traders several key
advantages, including the potential for higher returns on
capital using early management, increased flexibility in trade
selection, and the ability to profit stack by trading options
				alongside other assets.</p>
<p>By understanding and utilizing these advantages, options
traders can optimize their performance, adapt to changing
market conditions, and potentially increase their overall returns.
However, it’s crucial to approach these margin types
with caution and employ disciplined risk management and
position sizing to navigate the increased leverage and potential
risks effectively.</p>
