			<h2>Chapter 7 point 3: Crash-Proof Position Sizing</h2>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we explored why wisely employing
SPAN/Portfolio margin can provide traders greater flexibility
and potentially higher returns due to several key advantages,
including profit stacking, increased flexibility in trade
structures, and the concept of early management, for more
efficient return optimization. We also covered potential risks
and considerations with using margin including the concept
				of margin expansion.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will delve into some guidelines for optimally
sizing an options portfolio with the goal of appropriate
	risk management and efficient capital utilization.</p>
			<p><b>What Is Position Sizing?</b></p>
<p>In layman’s terms, position sizing is basically how much buying power, planned capital, or margin you’re going to allocate
to a trade or to your trading strategy as a whole taking
	into account that buying power requirements can change.</p>
<p>It is the process of determining the optimal number of contracts
to trade based on your account size, risk tolerance,
	and the specific characteristics of the trade itself.</p>
			<p><b>Why Size Matters</b></p>
<p>Proper position sizing helps to ensure that no single trade
can decimate your account, while also allowing you to capitalize
	on profitable opportunities.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what trading style you have — whether you
are buying options or selling options, following a trend, or
trading non-directionally — position sizing is important for all
of it. However, in the case of option selling using margin, it is
even more critical because of the associated tail risk and the
effects that volatility expansion events and dynamic margin
	requirements can have on a portfolio.</p>
<p>One should never risk blowing up their entire account due
	to improper position sizing.</p>
			<p><b>Common Approaches to Position Sizing</b></p>
<p>Position sizing is a critical aspect of options trading that is often
not fully understood by both new and experienced traders
alike because it is one of the most challenging aspects
	of optimizing a trading plan.</p>
<p>One common approach to position sizing is the fixed percentage
method. With this approach, traders risk a fixed percentage of their account balance on each trade. For example,
	a trader might risk 2 percent of their account on every trade.
If the account balance is fifyt-thousand dollars, the trader would allocate
thousand dollars to each position. This method helps to ensure that
no single trade can significantly deplete the account, as the
	risk is spread across multiple positions.</p>
<p>Another approach is to dedicate a specific portion of buying
power to a particular strategy. For example, a trader may
choose to allocate only 30 percent of their buying power to a single
	strategy to manage risk.</p>
			<p><b>The All-Market Profits Approach</b></p>
<p>I take a more nuanced approach to position sizing that accounts
for the unique aspects of a trade structure and the
overall market environment. Our primary objective is to create
a crash-proof portfolio that can withstand even the most
severe market downturns while still allowing for optimal capital
efficiency and returns. To achieve this, we must account
for volatility expansion, margin expansion, worst-case scenario
	analysis, and maximum margin requirements.</p>
<p><b>Key Position Sizing Considerations: Volatility Expansion
	&amp; Margin Expansion</b></p>
<p><strong>Volatility expansion</strong> typically occurs during binary events or
violent selloffs, causing existing positions to use more of our
available buying power, even if the strikes are not close to
being in-the-money. This is a significant risk for option sellers,
as it can lead to margin calls and forced liquidations.
Margin expansion occurs when the amount of margin required
	to maintain an open position increases as time passes.</p>
			<p><strong>Margin expansion</strong> can occur in two different scenarios:
when selling naked options or when using SPAN and/or Portfolio
Margin. It happens when the amount of margin required
to maintain an open position increases as time passes, even
if the broker initially approved the trade. This happens because
the broker’s initial assessment of the required margin
				may no longer be sufficient as market conditions change.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you open a position with an initial margin
requirement of twleve thousand dollars, and your account has a balance
of fifteen thousand dollars. Your broker approves the trade, and you have
three thousand dollars in available funds. However, as the trade progresses,
you may see your available balance decrease to seven thousand dollars,
while your margin requirement expands to sixteen thousand dollars. This situation
puts you at risk of over-leveraging your account and
potentially facing a margin call.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Maximum Margin Requirement Through Worst-Case
Scenario Analysis</b></p>
			<p>Maximum Margin Requirement is the highest amount of
margin needed to maintain an open position under the most
adverse market conditions. It is determined by thoroughly
backtesting a trading strategy across various market scenarios,
including normal market conditions and worst-case
situations like market crash periods of high volatility or depending
				on the trade structure a low volatility environment.</p>
<p>By evaluating these scenarios during backtesting, traders
can identify the highest margin requirement encountered,
	which becomes the Maximum Margin Requirement.</p>
<p>Once you have determined the Maximum Margin Requirement and understand the potential for margin expansion,
you can use this information to make informed decisions
about position sizing. I’ve listed below my process for determining
Position Sizing.</p>
			<p class="center-text">My Process for Determining Optimal Position Sizing</p>
			<p>When it comes to determining optimal position sizing, I follow
a thorough and systematic approach that involves both
art and science. Again, my goal is to have no surprises when
it comes to drawdowns. This is especially important in an
options portfolio where leverage is involved. I look at actual
drawdowns versus actual returns when I calculate the worstcase
scenario. This process allows me to properly size my
				positions within the portfolio.</p>
<p>Below is an overview of the steps I take for determining position
	sizing:</p>
			<p><strong>Step number 1) Backtest One Tranche of the Trading Structure</strong></p>
<p>The first step I take when determining the optimal position
sizing and planned capital to devote to a trade is to backtest
one tranche of the trading structure that I want to analyze.
I do this over a significant period, typically 8 years or more,
which includes various market conditions. By focusing on
backtesting a single tranche, I can gain a clear understanding
of how the trade structure performs and what the margin
	requirements might look like in different scenarios.</p>
			<p><b>Step number 2) Analyze Margin Usage</b></p>
<p>After backtesting one tranche of the trade structure, I examine
the margin being used by the trade structure for each
day within the backtest period. This is a meticulous process
where I look at every single day from the backtested period,
identifying the day with the highest margin usage. This day
represents the worst-case scenario, and the highest margin
requirement encountered during this backtested period is
	what I refer to as the Maximum Margin Requirement.</p>
			<p><b>Step number 3) Establish a Maximum Margin Requirement Buffer</b></p>
<p>Once I have determined the Maximum Margin Requirement,
I take into account the fact that potential future market conditions
may be worse than the historical worst-case scenario.
To ensure that I have sufficient capital to withstand worstcase
scenarios without risking a margin call, I set my position
sizing so that the worst-case margin expansion remains under
a certain buffer based on my targeted risk profile for
the trade. For example, 80% maximum of the account’s net
liquidation value. This buffer percentage is crucial for deciding
how much capital to trade based on the worst-case
	situations where the margin expands the most.</p>
			<p><b>Step number 4) Calculate Planned Capital Allocation Per Tranche</b></p>
<p>To calculate the capital allocation per tranche, I use the Maximum
Margin Requirement and the selected buffer percentage.
For example, if the worst-case margin usage for one
tranche is six thousand dollars, and I want to keep the worst-case margin
expansion under 80 percent, I would allocate seven thousand five hundred dollars per tranche
(six thousand dollars / 0 point 8 = seven thousand five hundred dollars). This ensures that I have enough
capital to cover the potential margin expansion while still
	maintaining a safety net.</p>
<p><b>Step number 5) Stress Test the Positions Sizing Through Historical
	Scenarios</b></p>
<p>Finally, after determining the position sizing per tranche, I
will then backtest the trading strategy again by examining
its performance under different market scenarios, such as
crash, grind-down, sideways, and up markets. This process
helps me validate the effectiveness of my position sizing
methodology and ensures that it can withstand various market
conditions. By stress-testing the structure, I can make
any necessary adjustments to my position sizing approach
	to better prepare for potential market upheavals.</p>
<p><b>Summary: My Process for Determining Optimal Position
	Sizing</b></p>
			<p>Though it’s time-consuming, this process is essential for
making informed decisions about position sizing. It’s important
to note that every trader should tailor their own position
sizing guidelines to align with their individual risk tolerance
and account size, rather than simply copying someone else’s
approach. Also, it is my opinion that, as an account grows
larger, it’s appropriate to take less risk. In smaller accounts,
traders might use more buying power and take on more risk,
but as the account size increases, the percentage of buying
power used could be decreased.</p>
