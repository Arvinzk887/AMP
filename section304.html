		<p class="center-text"><b>Mark - Protecting and Growing His Retirement Portfolio</b></p>
		<p>Mark is an experienced options trader living in Brazil with an
			extensive background in spread trading.</p>
<p>Now in his late 50s and nearing retirement, his perspective
and priorities have shifted. The market volatility and lessons
of the dot-com crash, the 2008 financial crisis, and the 2022
	downturn have made capital preservation a key focus.</p>
<p>After following my YouTube channel and trades for a couple
of years and seeing their resiliency during 2022, Mark decided
to enroll in the mastermind program. He found that:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The non-directional, hedged strategy aligned with his
goal of generating steady returns while limiting downside
risk. It was a welcome change from his previous
directional spreads that performed well in up markets
			but suffered during corrections.</li>
<li>The systematic trade entry and management rules
made implementation simple and unobtrusive. Mark
could check his portfolio in 5 minutes each day and not
	be glued to his screens.</li>
<li>The extensive backtesting and live teaching gave him
the confidence to deploy the strategy in his own account.
Seeing the rules in action and having guardrails
in place eased any lingering skepticism.</li></ul>
		<p>In Mark’s words, “This provides the kind of diversification
			in a portfolio that you need without being too directional.</p>
<p>When you’re close to retirement with a sizable account, you
can’t put all your eggs in one basket and risk everything like
	when you were younger.”</p>
<p>By reallocating a portion of his portfolio to the All-Market
Profits type strategies, Mark aims to achieve “outsized
risk-adjusted returns” heading into retirement, capturing
healthy profits during good times while defending against
	deep drawdowns.</p>
<p>He plans to increase his allocation to potentially half his
	portfolio or more over time.</p>
<p>To see how a strategy designed for steady performance in
all market environments could help bulletproof your retirement
portfolio, review the 4 key market regimes covered in
Chapters 6-8. Then, put the pieces together in Chapters 6-8
to build an “All-Market” approach of your own.</p>
		<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
		<p class="center-text"><b>Nathaniel - Discovering a Life-Changing, Stress-Free Trading Strategy</b></p>
		<p>Nathaniel is a self-employed trader from Connecticut who
has been actively involved in the stock market since graduating
college in 2019. His trading experience spans longterm
investing, swing trading, day trading, and non-directional
			options strategies.</p>
<p>Despite his mathematical background and intermediate-level
understanding of options trading, Nathaniel struggled to
find a reliable, stress-free approach to building wealth in the
	markets.</p>
<p>After following my work for several years and successfully
implementing his other trading strategies, Nathaniel decided
to enroll in the All-Market Profits mentorship program.
	The experience was transformative.</p>
<p>In Nathaniel’s own words, “I swear I’m not exaggerating. It
really feels like there’s a little bit of a light at the end of the
tunnel in terms of being able to relax a little bit, work a little
less, and be away from my computer a little bit more. For
the first time in a long time, I’m really feeling like this strategy
could really change my life. I’m going to trade this for
	decades.”</p>
<p><b>The key benefits Nathaniel found in the All-Market Profits
	trading include:</b></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>The extensive backtesting across various market conditions
gave him unshakeable confidence in the strategy’s
durability and long-term profitability. Unlike his previous
trading systems that quickly lost their edge, the
			AMP methodology had proven resilient year after year.</li>
			<li>The systematic, rules-based approach removed the
stress and subjectivity of his active trading days. Nathaniel
could now manage his portfolio with minimal
				time commitment without being glued to his screens.</li>
			<li>The strategy’s defensive nature and lower drawdowns
aligned perfectly with his risk-averse nature. As a longterm
investor, Nathaniel appreciated how the AMP approach
offered steadier returns than buy-and-hold with
far milder drawdowns.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Nathaniel plans to allocate up to two-thirds of his net worth
to the All-Market Profits trading strategies with the goal of
potentially increasing that allocation up to 100% as his confidence
in navigating margin expansion grows. He sees this
not just as an investing strategy but as a vehicle to achieve
his early retirement goals by generating reliable, stress-free
			passive income.</p>
<p>For long-term investors seeking a more peaceful, profitable
alternative to the roller coaster of buy-and-hold, explore
how the All-Market Profit’s strategies and unique usage of
options Greeks (Chapter 6) and strategic trade structure
(Chapter 7) can help you escape the “work until you’re 65”
	grind and retire on your own terms.</p>
<p>Those case studies are just a sample of the dozens of client
videos I’ve recorded and you can watch each interview on
	my website.</p>
<p>The battle-scarred traders I’ve taught my trading approaches
to all have to seek transparency, backtests, and performance
evaluations. They desire realistic returns while prioritizing
risk management and they want independence and
	self-sufficiency as a trader.</p>
		<p><b>But, what about your trading?</b></p>
<p>As unique as each trader’s path is, there are core questions
that can help you assess whether the All-Market Profits strategies
will align with your specific trading aspirations and current
	situation.</p>
<p>The following questions are designed to prompt reflection
on key aspects of your trading approach and to evaluate if
the principles you’ll learn in this book correspond to your
	needs and expectations.</p>
<p>Take a moment to answer the following questions, and remember,
it’s not just about understanding the strategy but
also about recognizing your individual trading style, goals,
and challenges.</p>
