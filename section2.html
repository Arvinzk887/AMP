          <h2>Chapter 1: Becoming an All Market Trader</h2>
            <p>Don’t be like me.</p>
            <p>At the time of this writing, I am 56 years old. I’ve been obsessed with passive income ever since I was 19. My goal has always been the same: make as much money with as little “work” as possible.</p>
            <p>In other words, I wanted to retire early and do what I wanted to do when I wanted to do it and not have money get in the way - I am sure most of you share that common goal.</p>
          <p>On my quest for “financial independence,” I’ve fixed and flipped real estate, owned rental properties, purchased a laundromat, invested in franchises, and gotten involved with many other passive income “business opportunities” not worth mentioning.</p>
          <p>But, they all had one drawback – the financial investment was large but so was the investment of time…something I 13 really didn’t have back then as a father of four (a son and triplet daughters).</p>
          <p>That's when I turned to online trading.</p>
          <p>The allure of “working” from anywhere without any employees or overhead sucked me right in. I could escape the rat race, provide for my family, and live a lifestyle with financial security while my capital grew as I slept.</p>
          <p>On this quest to trade for a living, I tried fundamental analysis and stock picking, but that didn’t meet my goals.</p>
          <p>I tried technical analysis, but the ambiguity left more to be desired. I had a brief stint in buying options, but the low probabilities crushed my account.</p>
          <p>That’s when I finally “thought” I had found my edge in selling options. I could use an arsenal of “traditional” options selling structures such as spreads, calendars, iron condors, and butterflies and make money regardless of whether the market went up, down, or sideways.</p>
          <p>With time decay and the high probabilities on my side, my initial jaunt into premium selling had me feeling on top of the world.</p>
          <p>I won 95%+ of my trades, collected my weekly paychecks, and felt invincible. With this newfound sense of confidence, I decided to liquidate all my other assets (I had a few rental properties at the time) and put all my capital into my trading account with the dream of quitting my corporate job and trading for a living.</p>
          <p><strong>That dream was taken away from me one day:</strong> September 30th, 2008.</p>
          <p>The fateful Monday was one of the early days of the “Great Recession.” President Bush was supposed to sign off on the TARP relief program. When he failed to do that, the market went into a tailspin. The VIX volatility index spiked to almost 70, <strong>and my account blew up!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Not knowing what to do, I sat paralyzed in my home office chair, only getting up once to pick up a call on my landline phone. It was a gentleman from TD Ameritrade - my broker at the time.</p>
          <p>Reality soon began to set in, and I realized this call was the last call any trader ever wanted to receive. I was getting margin called, and I needed to liquidate my positions. My stomach sank, thinking I had just lost years of growing my assets, my trading account, and my life savings.</p>
          <p><strong><em>But, it was worse…</em></strong>;</p>
          <p>Not only did I have to close all of my positions due to massive losses but the broker also told me that I owed $125,000 on top of what I had already lost!</p>
          <p>As you can imagine, I was in bad shape and desperate: I had to borrow against my credit cards to pay off my broker. My stress spiked just as hard as the market crashed. It was so bad that the asthma I had as a child suddenly came back - decades after I last experienced it.</p>
          <p>Here I was, 38 years old, with a wife and four children. I had started trading in the markets with the dream of providing for my family and retiring early. Instead, I was in debt, I had 15 no trading capital, and now I had to walk around, not only with my self-imposed shame but also with an inhaler in my pocket for my newfound asthma.</p>
          <p>It was my ultimate low point. It was hard for me to admit at the time, but after many years of studying, I clearly didn’t know what I needed to know to make money in ALL market environments.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, I was beaten down but not broken. I used this painful moment as a catalyst for what would be another 10- year journey to re-educate myself on what it actually takes to trade options for a living. Now, because I never want you to be in the position I found myself in, I am writing this book to share with you the lessons, principles, and tactics I’ve uncovered along the way.</p>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
          <p class="center-text">&nbsp;<strong>Rising From the Ashes</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Blowing up your account and going into debt will turn you into a different person. I knew that if I was to ever have success with trading, I needed to arm myself with a different set of tools, beliefs, and, most importantly, a set of clear, well-defined goals.</p>
          <p>It’s essential to define what success looks like to me. Trading is only worth my time and effort if it meets <strong>three key criteria:</strong></p>
			<ol>
          <li>It needs to outperform the S&amp;P on a risk-adjusted basis (otherwise, I would simply invest in an index fund).</li>
          <li>It needs to be passive. Trading should be a means to an end, not an end in itself. I only really want to spend about 20 minutes a week trading (I want to trade for a 16 living and actually live).</li>
          <li>Finally, it needs to be safe, objective, and stress-free. I want to be able to go on vacation and not necessarily have to manage my account or look at my computer all the time.</li>
			</ol>
            <p>&nbsp;<strong>Ultimatel, my goal is to seek peaceful passive trading profits:</strong></p>
          <p>Optimize For Peaceful Trading Profits</p>
          <p>What that means is I optimize for high risk-adjusted returns, market outperformance, and making money in all market types. To achieve this goal, I obviously need high returns, and therefore, I need to harness a true trading edge.</p>
          <p>Next, I need to mitigate and control risk at all costs. This means low drawdowns and being safe in crashes so I can sleep easy at night and profit without panic. Finally, I need to eliminate the hassle. By this, I mean minimizing management complexity, emotions, and mental bandwidth. I use objective trading rules and limit my trading to around 20 minutes a week.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In other words, I needed to treat trading like a business. This is when I developed my options trading laboratory.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p class="center-text"><strong>My Options Trading Laboratory</strong></p>
		  <p>In this “laboratory,” I would use a different set of tools, such as historical options data, risk graphs, quantitative analysis, and a deeper-level knowledge of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-order Greeks, to create “unconventional” trade structures and plans. This is where I would get my proverbial “10,000” hours of options education.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>During these years, I personally developed and tested 198 different trading strategies. Here are the results:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>154 of my systems did NOT produce a profit. I rejected them.</li>
			<li>I thoroughly researched the remaining 44 trading models. I spent months and months backtesting each one of them. The ones that could NOT stand up to backtesting were eliminated.</li>
			<li>My refining process led to 17 models that were promising enough to forward-test using my own money. Only eight were successful.</li>
			<li>I then took the remaining eight models and tore them apart, turned them inside out, and flipped them upside down, looking for ANY FLAW in their design.</li>
			<li>Finally, after years of testing and disregarding 190 trading models, I’ve developed the remaining eight models into legitimate, money-making, proprietary trading systems.</li>
			</ul>
		    <p>These few have become the backbone of the low-risk, market-beating “All-Market Profits” strategies that have allowed me to trade for a living <strong>(and are what you’ll learn in this book)</strong>.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>WHAT IS THE ALL-MARKET PROFITS FRAMEWORK?</b></p>
          <p>The <strong><em>“All-Market Profits” Framework (A.M.P. for short)</em></strong> is a blueprint for designing, constructing, and implementing an options trading system that can safely outperform the S&amp;P 500 and preserve capital and profit in <strong>all markets</strong>.</p>
<p>The underlying thesis of “All-Market Profit” type strategies is that the key to outperformance is to harness an extractable edge and minimize drawdowns across all different market environments.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This can be achieved by placing a hyper-efficient, proactively hedged, and properly positioned premium selling option structure within a low maintenance, mechanical, and objective trading plan - resulting in a non-directional trading system that can weather all market environments without the need to predict future price movements.</p>
			<p>The Five Pillars of the A.M.P Trading Framework that you'll learn in Part 2 of This Book:</p>
			<p>Trade Structure</p>
			<p>Leverage (Margin)</p>
			<p>Position Sizing</p>
			<p>Entry Rules</p>
		    <p>Management Rules</p>
	      <p>I’ve written this book to reveal and share with you the core components of the All-Market Profit-type strategies in the coming chapters. 19 However, at a very high level, it is a: (1) properly-sized, (2) proactively-hedged, (3) multi-legged, premium-selling-options structure that is (4) placed within a mechanical, all-encompassing rule set.</p>
	      <p>&nbsp;<strong>The All-Market Profits Trading Framework relies on several premises:</strong></p>
		    <ul>
			<li>Future price movements cannot be accurately predicted, but volatility tends to revert to the mean.</li>
			<li>The selling of options provides a statistically proven edge.</li>
			<li>Controlling higher-order Greeks is the key to weathering all markets.</li>
			</ul>
<p>We will explore these premises throughout this book and
detail why accounting for them can result in a truly non-directional
trading strategy with the ability to weather all market
environments.</p>
		  <p class="center-text"><b>WHAT IS THE TRACK RECORD*:</b></p>
			<p>I have several “All-Market Profit” type strategies. However, one of my flagship strategies has been backtested and forward- tested to roughly make twice the market returns of the S&amp;P 500 with approximately one-third of the risk.</p>
		    <p>I've included a sample equity curve below:</p>
	      <p>Since 2015, this strategy’s Compound Annual Growth Rate has been 20.99%, indicating substantial growth year over year, outpacing benchmarks such as the S&amp;P 500, which had a CAGR of approximately 10% in the same period.&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>At this rate, the account would double every three to four years compared to the S&amp;P 500, which would take ~7 to 8 years to double.</p>
		    <p>This particular strategy has maintained a relatively stable equity curve, minimizing the severity and length of drawdowns even during challenging market conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center-text"><b>DRAWDOWN MITIGATION</b></p>
		  <p>The key metrics here pertain to the risk and drawdowns.
			  Some trading strategies might make 50%+ one year only
			  to be followed by a massive 50% drawdown the next. No
			  right-minded investor wants high drawdowns like this for
			  one simple reason - it takes a 100% return to compensate
			  for a 50% drawdown. That’s why the key to long-term market
			  success is to reduce drawdowns and focus on high-risk-adjusted
			  returns.</p>
		  <p>With this particular A.M.P. Strategy, there have been no losing
			  years from 2015-2023 while keeping drawdowns low.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p> Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 had three years of losses from
			  2015 to 2023.</p>
		  <p>The large drawdown, measured as the largest peak-totrough
		    decline in the strategy’s account value, was -10.13%,
		    and it took only 14 days to recover.</p>
		  <p>Another helpful chart to visualize the minimal account volatility of an A.M.P.-style trading system is an underwater plot.</p>
		  <p>An underwater plot visually represents how far and for how long investments are “underwater” — meaning how much below the peak value they have fallen and how long they remain below that peak before recovering.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>This chart is particularly useful for illustrating an investment’s risk and recovery periods. As you can see in the underwater plot above, the magnitude and length of the drawdowns in this particular trading system are far superior to the S&amp;P 500.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p class="center-text"><b>ALL-MARKET PERFORMANCE</b></p>
		  <p>We will discuss this in further detail in Chapter 6 of this book, but what sets the All-Market Profits-type strategies apart is their ability to consistently outperform across various market environments.</p>
		  <p>At a high level, here is a quick breakdown of the common options selling market types and a snapshot of how an A.M.P.-style system performs.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>For option premium sellers, the market environment can be broken down into four categories: Sideways, Grind Downs, Rising Bulls, and Crash Market.</p>
		  <p class="center-text">The Sideways Market</p>
		  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Sideways Market is where prices fluctuate within a narrow range without forming any distinct trend upwards or downwards.</p>
		  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Sideways Market in the first six months of 2015 when the market stayed within a 4% range up or down and the VIX high was slightly above 23.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>A.M.P. Strategy Performance:</strong> From 1/2/2015 - 7/27/2015, the market (S&amp;P 500) only rose by 0.46% while the A.M.P. increased by 10.09%.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>From 7/15/2016 - 11/16/2016, the market (S&amp;P 500) only rose by 0.70% while this A.M.P. strategy increased by 5.88%.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>All-Market Profits strategies excel in sideways markets primarily due to their non-directional setup and positive Theta exposure.</p>
		  <p class="center-text">The Grind-Down Market</p>
		  <p><strong>&nbsp;Definition:</strong> A Grind-Down Market is a sustained period where the market prices decline by a certain percentage (around 10%+) over a given timeframe.</p>
		  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Grind-Down Market occurred from October 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, when the market was down 14.5% with a maximum VIX spike of approximately 25 points.</p>
		  <p><strong>A.M.P. Strategy Performance:</strong> From 9/20/2018 - 12/24/2018, the market (S&amp;P 500) drew down by -19.78% while the A.M.P. increased by 11.57%. From 1/03/2022 - 10/12/2022, the market (S&amp;P 500) drew down by -25.43% while the A.M.P. increased by 18.69%.</p>
		  <p>All-Market Profit strategies demonstrate resilience in grinddown markets by harnessing the power of the higher-order Greek known as Charm.</p>
		  <p class="center-text">The Rising Bull Market</p>
		  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Rising Bull Market can be defined as a sustained period in which the market continually rises and there is relatively low volatility.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>Example:</strong> For the entire year of 2017, there was a Rising Bull Market. The market (SPX or S&amp;P 500 stock market) rose over 19% while the highest VIX reading was under 17.5.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>A.M.P. Strategy Performance:</strong> From 12/24/2018 to 2/19/2020, the market (S&amp;P 500) rose by 44.02% while the A.M.P. rose by 14.39%. From 3/24/2020 - 1/3/2022, the market (S&amp;P 500) rose by 114.38% while the A.M.P. rose by 72.93%.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>All-Market Profit strategies perform well in bull markets primarily due to their positive Theta exposure. As the market rises, the strategy benefits from time decay while maintaining a non-directional stance, allowing it to capture profits without relying on directional bets.</p>
		  <p class="center-text">The Crash Market</p>
		  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A crash market is a sudden and significant drop in stock prices, typically defined as a decline of about 10% or more within a few days.</p>
		  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Crash Market occurred in August 2015 when the market dropped 13.13% in four days and the VIX went from 15 to over 53, a 38-point spike. Another Crash Market occurred in early February 2018 when the market fell over 10.5% in seven days and the VIX went from 12.5 to over 50 in four days. More recently, The March 2020 COVID Crash saw The S&amp;P 500 drop by approximately 34% in just over a month. Simultaneously, the VIX soared, jumping from around 15 to a peak of 82.69.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>A.M.P. Strategy Performance:</strong> In the flash crash of August 2015, the S&amp;P500 spiraled nearly 11% while the A.M.P. gained 5.41% in the same period. Then, in the crash of February 2018, the market dropped nearly 8.5% while this strategy gained 5.33%. Finally, in the COVID crash, the market dropped nearly 34% while this strategy only drew down 2.27%. All-Market Profit strategies exhibit remarkable resilience in crash markets due to their proactive hedging and long volatility exposure. By incorporating strategic hedges and harnessing the power of Vomma, these strategies can potentially generate profits, even during sharp market declines.</p>
		  <p class="center-text"><b>Trading For A Living</b></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p> These performance metrics are historical snapshots of just
			  one of my flagship All-Market Profits trading strategies. I hope they paint a compelling picture as to why the approaches
			  you will learn in this book can be suitable for traders seeking reliable growth and stability in their portfolios.</p>
		  <p> Combining high returns with mitigated drawdowns and performance
			  in all market conditions has empowered me to
			  trade for a living. More important than that is that I am now
			  able to spend my time where and how I choose.</p>
		  <p>As we move forward in this book, you’ll gain an understanding
			  of the principles needed for constructing your own
			  All-Market Profits strategy, tailored to your unique needs and
			  risk tolerance so you can build your own successful trading
			  business.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Once again (and as a gentle reminder), in order to get the
			  most out of this book, it is assumed you have intermediate
			  to&nbsp; advanced options trading understanding. If the terms
			  “CAGR,” “put,” “calls,” “Deltas,” or “butterfly” mean nothing
			  to you, I have a helpful companion video training program to
			  help complement the concepts taught in this book.

			<p class="center-text">Key Chapter Takeaways</p>
			<ol>
<li>The All-Market Profits (A.M.P.) Trading Framework was
born out of my personal journey toward trading for a living
and the painful lessons I learned along the way my
experience highlighted the need for a truly non-directional
system that could preserve capital in all market
environments while achieving outsized risk-adjusted
returns.</li>
			<li>All-Market Profits-style Trading systems rely on several
				premises
			<ol>
				<li>Future price movements cannot be accurately predicted, but volatility reversion can</li>
				<li>The selling of options provides astatistically proven edge</li>
				<li>That edge is incomplete due to direction and volatility risk</li>
				<li>Controlling higher-order Greeks is the key to weathering all markets.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>At the core of any all-market profits strategy is its performance across all four primary options-selling market types: rising bull markets, sideways markets, grinddown bear markets, and crash markets. By adapting to changing market conditions and employing robust risk management techniques, this A.M.P.-style strategy can generate strong risk-adjusted returns with lower drawdowns compared to traditional investment benchmarks.</li>
			<li>In Part 2 of this book, we will dive deep into the specific mechanics and principles behind the All-Market Profit Trading strategies. From trade structuring and Greek management to adaptation and risk control, this book will provide a comprehensive roadmap for implementing this powerful options selling approach.</li>
