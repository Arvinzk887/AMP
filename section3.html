          <h2>Chapter 2: Who Is This Book For? The Battle-Scarred Trader</h2>
          <p>As I shared in the previous chapter, my journey to successful
              options trading was a long, frustrating process filled with
              countless hours of trial and error. I didn’t have a family member,
              friend, or traditional “mentor” to show me the ropes.</p>
          <p>Even worse, an overwhelming majority of the online trading courses I took were useless. They were taught by an untrustworthy instructor who failed to show their P&amp;L - because they were, in fact, unprofitable.</p>
          <p>Once I figured out how to trade for a living with my “All-Market Profits” strategies, I began showcasing my trading results on YouTube in an effort to help other traders avoid the pitfalls and challenges I faced. By sharing the P&amp;L of all my accounts every week, I aimed to prove the effectiveness of my systems and inspire other “real trading educators” to follow suit.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Then, in 2020, due to demand from my channel followers, I started teaching my trading and investing approaches to other interested traders. Though I’ve now taught my All-Market Profit strategies to traders from all over the world, I noticed that there was one common thread - nearly everyone is what I call a “battle- scarred” trader.</p>
			<p class="center-text">This book is for you if you are a "Battle-Scarred Trader"</p>
		  <p>A battle-scarred trader is an individual who has been through
			  the gauntlet of education courses and trading strategies
			  only to come out disillusioned. Like me, they had faced similar
			  struggles and challenges on their trading journeys, often
			  feeling lost, frustrated, and unsure of where to turn for genuine
			  guidance and support.</p>
		  <p>They are sold on the idea of trading as a means to produce
			  passive income but have either yet to become consistently
			  profitable or are seeking better strategies than what they
			  are currently employing.</p>
		  <p>Battle-scarred traders come in all shapes and sizes.</p>
		  <p>Some are in retirement or approaching retirement and aim
			  to preserve their capital at all costs, potentially trade for a
			  living, and bankroll their sunset years.</p>
		  <p>Others are 9-5ers who can’t sit at their computer all day to
			  trade. They need a trading approach that integrates with
			  their busy professional lives.</p>
		  <p>A vast majority of battle-scarred traders are people who are
or were option premium sellers who’ve been through crashes
and learned the hard way to prioritize “risk-adjusted” returns
over the trap of “high-win rates.”</p>
		  <p>Then, there’s a minority of battle-scarred traders who are
			  already very profitable and have built up an extensive portfolio
			  but want a diversification strategy for lasting passive
			  income and wealth.</p>
		  <p>My question: are you a battle-scarred trader?</p>
		  <p>If so, you are not alone.</p>
			<p>This book and the framework revealed within are suitable
			  for you if you wish to inch one step closer to lasting market
			  success.
			  But, don’t just take my word for it…
			  Here are examples from past clients on how All-Market Profit
			  strategies can be tailored to fit your unique trading and Investing
			  goals:</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text">Marcel - Fitting Trading into His Busy 9-5</p>
			<p>Marcel is a business professional from Germany. As a business
development manager for an American company, his
				work responsibilities kept him extremely busy.</p>
<p>His previous trading experience included a mix of long stock
strategies and various unhedged options selling strategies
like cash-secured puts and covered calls. However, these
methods had some key limitations:</p>
			<ul><li>The time commitment often clashed with his professional
responsibilities, leaving him unable to adequately
				monitor and adjust positions during the workday.</li>
			<li>Individual stock positions carried too much single-company
risk exposure. Diversifying across many stocks
				solved this but became too time-consuming to manage.</li>
				<li>He felt he was too often at the mercy of the market, unable
to control drawdowns during volatility spikes and
downturns. This left him stressed and losing sleep.</li></ul>
			<p>That’s why the minimal time required and risk control of
non-directional options strategies (like what you’ll learn in
this book) appealed to him. After implementing the A.M.P.
approach, Marcel found that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>He only needed 30 minutes per week to manage his
portfolio, which seamlessly fit into his busy professional
life. This freed up his workday and eliminated trade
				management stress.</li>
<li>The defined risk and proactive hedging gave him peace
of mind. He could handle his job responsibilities without
	worrying about catastrophic losses decimating his account.</li>
				<li>The consistent, stable returns, while not shooting for
“home runs,” gave him confidence in reaching his financial
goals over time without disrupting his career or
family life.</li></ul>
			<p>In Marcel’s own words, “It’s easier than you think... You can
do this next to your regular job and still make a very good
				amount of money in a very safe way.”</p>
<p>By making the switch to non-directional options trading,
Marcel gained not only better risk-adjusted returns but invaluable
	peace of mind and work-life balance.</p>
<p>If you also value consistent, low-stress profits that don’t hijack
your daily schedule, focus on Chapter 7, which details
building an optimized options structure, and Chapter 7.5 on
managing the strategy in just minutes each week.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Martin - Guarding and Growing His Nest Egg</b></p>
			<p>Martin is a retiree currently living in Durham, North Carolina.
Like many battle-scarred traders, he went through several
trading education services over the years, such as tastytrade,
but ultimately became jaded with the complexity, lack
				of transparency, and lackluster results of their strategies.</p>
<p>His core goal was simple but essential for someone in retirement:
preserve his capital at all costs and achieve steady
returns of 10%-15% per year without the stress of large drawdowns
so he and his wife could enjoy their golden years
	with greater peace of mind.</p>
<p>After discovering the All-Market Profits approach, Martin
found that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The extensive backtesting across various market conditions
gave him confidence the strategy could deliver reliable
returns with tolerable drawdowns. No more wide
				swings or sleepless nights.</li>
				<li>The clear, objective trade rules eliminated the guess-
work and subjectivity that plagued his previous strategies.
					He could finally trade with consistency and conviction.</li>
				<li>The minimal time commitment allowed him to still travel
and live life without being glued to his screens all day.
20 minutes a day was all he needed to manage his retirement
nest egg.</li></ul>
			<p>In Martin’s words, “I’m at an age where I can’t have the mindset
that I can go down 30% because I’ve got time to make it
up. Well, no - I don’t have time to make it up. This discipline
				is exactly what I was looking for.”</p>
<p>By gaining a proven system to grow his nest egg with greater
stability and less stress, Martin has been able to spend
less time worrying about the markets and more time enjoying
retirement with his wife - including a trip to Rome where
he was so eager to get started he signed up for the program
	from his hotel room.</p>
<p>If steady, stress-free returns are your priority, focus on Chapters
7 and 8 to discover how to create an All-Market Profits
strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and retirement lifestyle
goals. You can guard and grow your nest egg in retirement
without sacrificing your well-being or precious time.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Brian - Finally on the Path to Profitable Trading</b></p>
			<p>Brian is an intelligent, hard-working hospital software support
analyst with a decade of experience trading options,
stocks, and futures - yet, he had never had a profitable year.
This left him disillusioned with the flashy promises but lackluster
				results of other strategies and programs.</p>
<p>After discovering the All-Market Profits trading, Brian found
that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The extensive backtesting across various market conditions
gave him confidence the strategy could deliver reliable
returns. He finally had a plan he could trust, even
				when trades went against him.</li>
				<li>The clear, objective trade rules provided the consistency
and simplicity he craved. No more blindly following
					gurus and jumping from method to method.</li>
				<li>The minimal time commitment fit his busy professional
life. He didn’t have to be glued to his screens all day to
manage his portfolio.</li></ul>
			<p>In Brian’s words, “Now, I have a plan that I trust. I see the
market conditions, and I’m not worried because I have the
history to back it up. I’m finally on the path to my first profitable
				year in trading.”</p>
<p>By gaining a proven system he could implement with consistency
and confidence, Brian has been able to stop chasing
the latest trading fads and instead focus on executing a reliable
plan for long-term wealth building.</p>
<p>To discover the trading plan Brian is using to target his first
profitable year, dive into Chapter 7 and start building your
All-Market Profits portfolio. You can break the cycle of trading
losses and start down a more peaceful, proven path.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Bogdan and the Need to Hedge</b></p>
			<p>Bogdan, a principal software engineer manager at Microsoft,
had a clear vision for his trading. He aimed to find a strategy
to safeguard his investments from market volatility, avoiding
				the risks of large drawdowns and account blow-ups.</p>
<p>In his early trading days, Bogdan explored various strategies
but often found them lacking safety measures - particularly
that they were not properly hedged against black swan
	events.</p>
<p>When asked about the All-Market Profits approach, Bogdan
said,
“The most valuable thing that you brought me is that basically
everything is hedged. I haven’t seen one structure,
one trading structure that you are talking about that is not
hedged. I’m a very safe guy. I don’t want to blow up my account
	in the next year.”</p>
<p>Hedging is a critical component of the All-Market Profits
strategies. The proactively hedged options structure taught
in Chapter 7.1 is designed to protect capital during volatility
	spikes and market crashes.</p>
<p>By deploying this “always hedged” approach, Bogdan can
more confidently navigate market turmoil, helping him stay
	the course and avoid emotionally driven mistakes.</p>
<p>If minimizing drawdowns is a priority in your trading, study
Chapter 6 to understand how the All-Market Profits strategies
harness the Greeks to remain truly non-directional.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Mark - Protecting and Growing His Retirement Portfolio</b></p>
			<p>Mark is an experienced options trader living in Brazil with an
				extensive background in spread trading.</p>
<p>Now in his late 50s and nearing retirement, his perspective
and priorities have shifted. The market volatility and lessons
of the dot-com crash, the 2008 financial crisis, and the 2022
	downturn have made capital preservation a key focus.</p>
<p>After following my YouTube channel and trades for a couple
of years and seeing their resiliency during 2022, Mark decided
to enroll in the mastermind program. He found that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The non-directional, hedged strategy aligned with his
goal of generating steady returns while limiting downside
risk. It was a welcome change from his previous
directional spreads that performed well in up markets
				but suffered during corrections.</li>
<li>The systematic trade entry and management rules
made implementation simple and unobtrusive. Mark
could check his portfolio in 5 minutes each day and not
	be glued to his screens.</li>
<li>The extensive backtesting and live teaching gave him
the confidence to deploy the strategy in his own account.
Seeing the rules in action and having guardrails
in place eased any lingering skepticism.</li></ul>
			<p>In Mark’s words, “This provides the kind of diversification
				in a portfolio that you need without being too directional.</p>
<p>When you’re close to retirement with a sizable account, you
can’t put all your eggs in one basket and risk everything like
	when you were younger.”</p>
<p>By reallocating a portion of his portfolio to the All-Market
Profits type strategies, Mark aims to achieve “outsized
risk-adjusted returns” heading into retirement, capturing
healthy profits during good times while defending against
	deep drawdowns.</p>
<p>He plans to increase his allocation to potentially half his
	portfolio or more over time.</p>
<p>To see how a strategy designed for steady performance in
all market environments could help bulletproof your retirement
portfolio, review the 4 key market regimes covered in
Chapters 6-8. Then, put the pieces together in Chapters 6-8
to build an “All-Market” approach of your own.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Nathaniel - Discovering a Life-Changing, Stress-Free Trading Strategy</b></p>
			<p>Nathaniel is a self-employed trader from Connecticut who
has been actively involved in the stock market since graduating
college in 2019. His trading experience spans longterm
investing, swing trading, day trading, and non-directional
				options strategies.</p>
<p>Despite his mathematical background and intermediate-level
understanding of options trading, Nathaniel struggled to
find a reliable, stress-free approach to building wealth in the
	markets.</p>
<p>After following my work for several years and successfully
implementing his other trading strategies, Nathaniel decided
to enroll in the All-Market Profits mentorship program.
	The experience was transformative.</p>
<p>In Nathaniel’s own words, “I swear I’m not exaggerating. It
really feels like there’s a little bit of a light at the end of the
tunnel in terms of being able to relax a little bit, work a little
less, and be away from my computer a little bit more. For
the first time in a long time, I’m really feeling like this strategy
could really change my life. I’m going to trade this for
	decades.”</p>
<p><b>The key benefits Nathaniel found in the All-Market Profits
	trading include:</b></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The extensive backtesting across various market conditions
gave him unshakeable confidence in the strategy’s
durability and long-term profitability. Unlike his previous
trading systems that quickly lost their edge, the
				AMS methodology had proven resilient year after year.</li>
				<li>The systematic, rules-based approach removed the
stress and subjectivity of his active trading days. Nathaniel
could now manage his portfolio with minimal
					time commitment without being glued to his screens.</li>
				<li>The strategy’s defensive nature and lower drawdowns
aligned perfectly with his risk-averse nature. As a longterm
investor, Nathaniel appreciated how the AMS approach
offered steadier returns than buy-and-hold with
far milder drawdowns.</li></ul>
			<p>Nathaniel plans to allocate up to two-thirds of his net worth
to the All-Market Profits trading strategies with the goal of
potentially increasing that allocation up to 100% as his confidence
in navigating margin expansion grows. He sees this
not just as an investing strategy but as a vehicle to achieve
his early retirement goals by generating reliable, stress-free
				passive income.</p>
<p>For long-term investors seeking a more peaceful, profitable
alternative to the roller coaster of buy-and-hold, explore
how the All-Market Profit’s strategies and unique usage of
options Greeks (Chapter 6) and strategic trade structure
(Chapter 7) can help you escape the “work until you’re 65”
	grind and retire on your own terms.</p>
<p>Those case studies are just a sample of the dozens of client
videos I’ve recorded and you can watch each interview on
	my website.</p>
<p>The battle-scarred traders I’ve taught my trading approaches
to all have to seek transparency, backtests, and performance
evaluations. They desire realistic returns while prioritizing
risk management and they want independence and
	self-sufficiency as a trader.</p>
			<p><b>But, what about your trading?</b></p>
<p>As unique as each trader’s path is, there are core questions
that can help you assess whether the All-Market Profits strategies
will align with your specific trading aspirations and current
	situation.</p>
<p>The following questions are designed to prompt reflection
on key aspects of your trading approach and to evaluate if
the principles you’ll learn in this book correspond to your
	needs and expectations.</p>
<p>Take a moment to answer the following questions, and remember,
it’s not just about understanding the strategy but
also about recognizing your individual trading style, goals,
and challenges.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Battle Scarred Trader Questionnaire</b></p>
			<p>Answer the following questions honestly to determine if
All-Market Profits trading aligns with your trading goals and
challenges. Rate each statement on a scale from 1 to 5,
where 1 means “strongly disagree” and 5 means “strongly
agree.”</p>
<p>Once you’ve rated yourself for each statement, total up your
scores and then use the Answer Key to determine your next
steps.</p>
