			<p class="center-text"><b>The Greeks</b></p>
			<p>Now, let’s turn our focus to briefly defining the first-order
Greeks - Delta, Theta, and Vega - which form the foundation
of options trading as well as the higher-order Greeks, such
as Gamma, Charm, and Vomma.</p>
			<p>First-Order Greeks: The Foundation
The first-order Greeks - Delta, Theta, and Vega - form the
foundation of options trading. Here’s a brief overview of
				each and how it relates to the A.M.P. 1-2-2 Structure:</p>
			<p><b>Theta:</b> Represents the rate of time decay of an option. This
is one of our edges. Premium sellers benefit from the passage
of time (all else being equal) - this is “Theta decay.” To
capitalize on this edge, we want to be Theta-positive, which
helps weather all market types except for crashes. In a crash,
another Greek (Vomma) takes over to make the trade structure
				profitable.</p>
			<p><b>Delta:</b> Represents the sensitivity of an option’s price to
changes in the value of the underlying security. If Delta is
not accounted for, you risk becoming directional and won’t
be able to fully take advantage of Theta decay. Our goal is
to be Delta-neutral to remove directional risk, meaning the
market moving up or down has little effect on the P&amp;L as
far as Delta is concerned. Delta neutrality helps weather all
				market types except for crashes.</p>
			<p><b>Vega:</b> Represents an option’s sensitivity to volatility. If you
are positive Theta, you are typically forced to be negative
Vega - meaning that as volatility increases, the P&amp;L will decrease
- this is a trade-off that we have to manage. Without
fully understanding Vega, you could make irrational trading
decisions. We aim to mitigate the effects of Vega across all
				market types.</p>
			<p><b>The A.M.P. 1-2-2 option structure</b> leverages these first-order
Greeks to create a more balanced and less directional
trade. By carefully selecting the strikes and expiration dates,
this structure can minimize the impact of Delta while benefiting
				from Theta decay and managing Vega risk.</p>
			<p>Higher-Order Greeks: The Hidden Market Forces</p>
<p>While many options traders focus solely on the first-order
Greeks, the real secret to success lies in understanding the
influences of higher-order Greeks, such as Gamma, Charm,
	and Vomma.</p>
			<p><b>Gamma:</b> Represents the rate of change of Delta. Delta can
be neutral, but price movements can still hurt you. Gamma-
neutral trades maintain a stable Delta even when the
underlying asset’s price changes, creating stability for every
market type (except for crashes). Furthermore, if you’re Gamma-
neutral, you can mitigate the effects of negative Vega
				because volatility expansions eventually revert to the mean.</p>
			<p><b>Charm:</b> Measures the rate of change of an option’s Delta
concerning time. I think of Charm as the future “personality”
of Delta and it needs to be taken into account to fully optimize
a non-directional trade plan. We want negative Charm
because our risk is to the downside. Negative Charm means
that the Delta of the position will become more negative
over time. This means if the market goes down, the position
				is making money based on negative Delta.</p>
			<p><b>Vomma:</b> Measures the sensitivity of an option’s Vega to
changes in the implied volatility of the underlying asset.
There’s only one asset guaranteed to rise in a market crash
- volatility. By being positive Vomma, our trade structure can
				potentially make money during crashes.</p>
			<p><b>The A.M.P. 1-2-2 option structure</b> takes advantage of these
higher-order Greeks to create a truly non-directional trade.
By being Theta-positive, Delta and Gamma-neutral, having
negative Charm, and being positive Vomma, this structure is
designed to weather all market types and potentially profit
during crashes.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Piecing it All Together: Understanding the Greeks in Different Market Types</b></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve explored why success in options trading is
contingent on not only an understanding of the first-order
Greeks but also a deep appreciation for the higher-order
Greeks, it’s time to switch gears and examine how these factors
				interact with various market conditions.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we’ll examine the Greeks through
the lens of the four primary options selling market types with
an emphasis on showcasing how the A.M.P. 1-2-2 trading
	structure can weather each.</p>
