			<p class="center-text"><b>Brian - Finally on the Path to Profitable Trading</b></p>
			<p>Brian is an intelligent, hard-working hospital software support
analyst with a decade of experience trading options,
stocks, and futures - yet, he had never had a profitable year.
This left him disillusioned with the flashy promises but lackluster
				results of other strategies and programs.</p>
<p>After discovering the All-Market Profits trading, Brian found
that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The extensive backtesting across various market conditions
gave him confidence the strategy could deliver reliable
returns. He finally had a plan he could trust, even
				when trades went against him.</li>
				<li>The clear, objective trade rules provided the consistency
and simplicity he craved. No more blindly following
					gurus and jumping from method to method.</li>
				<li>The minimal time commitment fit his busy professional
life. He didn’t have to be glued to his screens all day to
manage his portfolio.</li></ul>
			<p>In Brian’s words, “Now, I have a plan that I trust. I see the
market conditions, and I’m not worried because I have the
history to back it up. I’m finally on the path to my first profitable
				year in trading.”</p>
<p>By gaining a proven system he could implement with consistency
and confidence, Brian has been able to stop chasing
the latest trading fads and instead focus on executing a reliable
plan for long-term wealth building.</p>
<p>To discover the trading plan Brian is using to target his first
profitable year, dive into Chapter 7 and start building your
All-Market Profits portfolio. You can break the cycle of trading
losses and start down a more peaceful, proven path.</p>

				<p class="center-text"><strong>Eric - Seeking Self-Sufficiency</strong></p>
				<p>Before trading with All-Market Profit strategies, Eric dabbled
in options trading for about a year and a half using strategies
like the Wheel Strategy. He found moderate success
but soon realized the limitations of his strategies, especially
					during grind-down bear markets.</p>
<p>Eric also wanted to achieve complete independence with
	trading.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to rely on alert services to copy trades, as
that was not an effective learning strategy. That’s why he
valued the objective, rules-based approach of All-Market
	Profit strategies.</p>
<p>In Eric’s words, “I feel, for the first time in my short-option
trading career, that I have something that I can continue doing
on my own in perpetuity. What I’m really looking for is
	complete independence as a trader.”</p>
<p>By mastering a set of rational, well-defined trading rules, Eric
gained the knowledge and abilities to profitably trade on his
own for the long term. No longer would his success be tied
	to someone else’s alerts or decisions.</p>
<p>If self-sufficiency is your goal as a trader, pay close attention
to the trade entry and management rules covered in Chapters
7 point 4 and 7 point 5. Internalizing a set of objective principles is
the key to consistent, independent trading success.</p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Client Case Study</b></p>
			<p class="center-text"><b>Bogdan and the Need to Hedge</b></p>
			<p>Bogdan, a principal software engineer manager at Microsoft,
had a clear vision for his trading. He aimed to find a strategy
to safeguard his investments from market volatility, avoiding
				the risks of large drawdowns and account blow-ups.</p>
<p>In his early trading days, Bogdan explored various strategies
but often found them lacking safety measures - particularly
that they were not properly hedged against black swan
	events.</p>
<p>When asked about the All-Market Profits approach, Bogdan
said,
“The most valuable thing that you brought me is that basically
everything is hedged. I haven’t seen one structure,
one trading structure that you are talking about that is not
hedged. I’m a very safe guy. I don’t want to blow up my account
	in the next year.”</p>
<p>Hedging is a critical component of the All-Market Profits
strategies. The proactively hedged options structure taught
in Chapter 7 point 1 is designed to protect capital during volatility
	spikes and market crashes.</p>
<p>By deploying this “always hedged” approach, Bogdan can
more confidently navigate market turmoil, helping him stay
	the course and avoid emotionally driven mistakes.</p>
<p>If minimizing drawdowns is a priority in your trading, study
Chapter 6 to understand how the All-Market Profits strategies
harness the Greeks to remain truly non-directional.</p>
